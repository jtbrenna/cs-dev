Senior Lecturer Robert M. Erickson, MS</h4>

<p>Bob  received the prestigious <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/theview/article.php?id=2628">2007 Kroepsch-Maurice Teaching Award</a>, having joined the Computer Science faculty in 1991 after completing his Master of Science degree at Clarkson University. </p>

<p>Bob focuses on a series of web technology courses that get students to think of the web not as a series of web pages, but rather as a user interface for computer programs<!-- (see this <a href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~erickson/education/trees/">tree identification</a> example)-->. Students' projects range from blogs, hotel management and social networking sites to volunteer opportunities (having been a <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmpr/theview/article.php?id=796">mentor</a> for seven years, Bob likes to point students in this direction).</p>

<p>In addition, Bob has written a textbook on Microsoft Office suite that students have found useful not just for the course but, based on the emails Bob receives, for years to come. One former student emailed, &quot;I still apply many of your lessons today &#151; still have your old textbook in my office &#151; do you have a new one?" The reply &#151; it's online, of course: <a href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~erickson/education/office/">2003 version</a> | <a href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~erickson/education/office2007/">2007 version</a>. </p>
