      Senior Lecturer Alison Pechenick, BSE, MS</h4>
    <p>Alison joined the Computer Science faculty in 2001, after two
      decades' experience as an engineer, support specialist (network
      and
      desktop), technical educator, and teacher of mathematics, physics
      and
      computer science in the US, Taiwan, Pakistan and Sweden.&nbsp; Her
      technical training began early, assisting with circuit board test
      and assembly in her parents' industrial process controls firm.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Passionate about the outdoors, embedded systems, GIS, and the
      elegance of
      mathematics and statistics as applied to computational science and
      machine learning, Alison will soon hold a second Master's degree
      (environmental engineering, May 2013).&nbsp; Her research involves
      a novel, multi-scale approach to analyzing the impact of roads
      upon streams in rural, forested watersheds.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Alison truly enjoys exploring technology alongside her
      students, in courses that range from MATLAB programming for
      engineers, applied scientists and mathematicians, to Visual Basic
      event-driven programming for students across campus, to Electrical
      Engineering Concepts (circuit analysis).&nbsp; She was the
      inaugural faculty co-advisor to UVM's student chapter of Engineers
      Without Borders, and is a proud member of The Order of the
      Engineer.&nbsp; To round out her
      portfolio, Alison leads our seniors in a seminar exploring ethical
      considerations of technology and advises UVM's Sailing Team.<br>
