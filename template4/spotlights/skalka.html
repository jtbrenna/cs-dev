Dr. Christian Skalka</h4>
<p>
Associate Professor Christian Skalka's research is supported  by grants from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and NASA. </p>
<p>His work focuses on programming languages, especially  languages such as Java that support secure distributed computing. <a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~skalka/skalka-pubs/skalka-ieesp05.pdf">Read his magazine  article</a> on this topic. <a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~skalka/TR/swe-7-07/"><img src="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/gfx/skalka_field.jpg" alt="Field work at the Vermont Monitoring Cooperative Meteorological site" border="0" class="alignright" /></a></p>
<p>More recently, Dr. Skalka's attention has turned to wireless  sensor network (WSN) programming. One current  project is an interdisciplinary effort to provide low-cost WSN  technology for monitoring the amount of water in  snowpack for hydrological forecasting; <a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~skalka/TR/swe-7-07/">see a trip report</a> on recent field work. Dr. Skalka also provides <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/?Page=research/ugresearch.php#skalka">research opportunities for undergraduates</a> in WSN programming.</p>
