<h3>Graduate Programs</h3>

Computer Science Graduate Coordinator: <a href=http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~xwu/home.html>Dr. Xindong Wu</a>

<p>The Department of Computer Science offers three graduate programs through the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~gradcoll/" target="_top">Graduate College</a>: a Master's Program, an Accelerated Master's Program (AMP), and an  interdisciplinary PhD program.</p>

<h4>Master's Program (MS)</h4>
<p>The Master's Program (MS) is a traditional two-year degree program that offers both a thesis and a nonthesis option. The <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=grad/ms-guide.php&amp;SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">Guide to the Master of Science Program in Computer Science</a> describes most features about the master's degree   program: admission requirements, when and how to apply, requirements for the MS degree, and teaching and research fellowships.</p>

<h4>Interdisciplinary PhD Program</h4>
<p>
The interdisciplinary PhD program in Computer Science offers study in both traditional and  cross-disciplinary areas such as bioinformatics and ecological modeling, and  includes graduate assistantships specifically designated for students involved in interdisciplinary areas. The <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=grad/phd-guide.php&amp;SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">Guide to the Doctor of Philosophy Program in Computer Science</a> describes most features about the PhD   program: admission requirements, when and how to apply, requirements for the PhD degree, and teaching and research fellowships.</p>
