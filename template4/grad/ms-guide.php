<h4>University Information</h4>

<p>The Graduate College oversees all graduate programs at the
University of Vermont. The Graduate College offices (656-3160) are
located in Waterman Building.  </p>

<p> The Graduate College sponsors many lectures and workshops of
interest. Early in the Fall Semester is the Graduate Teaching Fellow
Workshop, full of helpful hints and friendly advice on getting started
in the classroom. Later in your studies, you may want to attend the
Dissertation Writing Workshop, or give a talk at Graduate Research
Day. The College also sponsors a Graduate Teaching Fellow of the Year
competition. They administer Travel Mini-Grants for students to
present research at professional meetings.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~oies/">Office of International
Education</a> (656-4296) coordinates programs, events, and services of
special interest to international students. This includes Language and
Writing Workshops, assistance in academic and cultural adjustment, and
immigration and employment help. Their pamphlet &quot;Information and
Support Services for International Students and Their Advisors&quot;
is a valuable resource. They also assist applicants and new students
with obtaining I20 forms, Statements of Support, and more.</p>

<p> The Graduate Catalogue contains a wealth of essential
information. This document is now maintained on-line at <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/catalogue/">www.uvm.edu/catalogue/</a>. The
University's policies are contained in a document called the <i>Cat's
Tale,</i> available at <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~dos/?Page=catstale.html">www.uvm.edu/~dos/?Page=catstale.html</a>. See

<h4>Information for Applicants</h4>
<br />
<h5>Applying to the Master's Program</h5>

<p>A student interested in a Master's degree in Computer Science must
submit a complete application packet including</p>

<ul>
  <li>the application form
(available on-line at:<br /> 
<a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~gradcoll/?Page=admissions.html">http://www.uvm.edu/~gradcoll/?Page=admissions.html</a>)</li>
  <li>complete collegiate transcripts </li>
  <li>statement of purpose (available as part of the packet) </li>
  <li>three reference letters </li>
</ul>

<p> In addition, Graduate Record Exam (GRE) general scores must be
submitted.  There is no cutoff GRE score required for admission; the
Department considers GRE scores as one factor in a complete
application packet. Past academic performance, reference letters, the
statement of purpose and any other exceptional circumstances all help
determine the applicant's suitability for the program. We admit
students who we believe are most likely to succeed and thrive in the
program.
</p>

<p>Applicants whose native language is not English or whose formal
education has been conducted in a language other than English must
have a Test of English as a Second Language (TOEFL) score of 550 (or
213 with computer-based test or 79 with Internet-based test) or above.
To be considered for financial assistantship from the University,
applicants must have a TOEFL score of 600 (or 250 with computer-based
test or 100 with Internet-base test) or above.  </p>

<p>Application deadlines are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Fall enrollment:</b> Apply by February 15</li>
  <li><b>Spring enrollment:</b> Apply by October 15</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications received after the deadlines are considered on a case-by-case basis.
</p>

<h5>Master's Program Pre-Requisites</h5>

<p> The Master's program assumes all incoming students have the
fundamental skills required of computer science students, with strong
programming skills in C, C++ or Java and a solid mathematical
background, including calculus, statistics, probability and discrete
mathematics.  </p>

<p>Typically entering students can demonstrate this background through
previous course work. A solid background for the program would include
the following courses: </p>

<ul>
  <li>2 semesters of programming in a modern, high-level programming language (CS21 and CS110 at UVM)</li>
  <li>1 course in computer organization, including exposure to assembly language and computer arithmetic (CS121) </li>
  <li>1 course in theory of computation (e.g. CS 125)</li>
  <li>1 course in data structures (CS124)</li>
  <li>Differential, integral and multivariate calculus (MATH 21+22)</li>
  <li>Discrete mathematics (CS64)</li>
  <li>Linear algebra (MATH 124)</li>
  <li>Statistics and probability (STAT 141, 151, or 153)</li>
</ul>

<p>Many students lack one or two of these courses. In this case, your
admission letter may state requirements to supplant your background in
addition to the requirements listed in the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=grad/ms-guide.php&SM=grad/_gradmenu.html#degreereqs">Degree
Requirements section</a>. Once these requirements have been completed,
you will be advanced to candidacy for the Master's Degree. Students
satisfying all the above requirements will normally be advanced to
candidacy upon being granted admission.

<p>All applicants must demonstrate a solid background before being
admitted.  Only applicants demonstrating at least the equivalent of
two of CS121, CS124, and CS125 and a reasonable background in mathematics
will be considered for admission.
</p>

<h5>Funding for Students</h5>

<p> The Department of Computer Science is able to fund a small number
of graduate students every year.</p>

<p>The most common form of funding is as a Graduate Teaching Assistant
(GTA). Each GTA spends 20 hours each week during the school year
(starting 1 week before classes begin) supporting the department's
educational mission. This work typically involves some combination of
grading, offering help sessions or office hours and monitoring student
labs. Each GTA will be assigned a specific number of hours for each
task and will work under the guidance of the faculty member teaching
the course or lab. Each GTA must also attend a series of short
training sessions early in their first semester.</p>

<p>The Graduate Committee nominates potential GTAs from the pool of
admitted students. GTAs are selected from the best students in the
program who best fit the department's needs. It is possible, to gain
GTA funding after one or more semesters as an unfunded graduate
student. GTA students who continue to satisfy the department's
requirements and make satisfactory progress towards their degree will
maintain their funding. </p>

<p> Funding as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) is also
available. The availability of research funding depends on the current
grants held by departmental faculty. Students with exception research
potential in the funded areas will be considered as GRAs. All admitted
students indicating interest in departmental funding will be
considered for all available funded positions. The only requirement of
the applicant is to indicate interest in departmental funding on the
application. </p>

<h5>Additional Information </h5>

<p> Hopefully, this document and the Department webpages (<a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/">www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/</a>) can
answer most of your questions about the program.  </p>

<p>Potential students should feel free to contact the department with
further questions. The email address <a
href="mailto:csgrad-info@cs.uvm.edu">csgrad-info@cs.uvm.edu</a> is the
best way to reach an appropriate member of the department to ask any
other questions you may have. </p>

<h4>Master's Degree Requirements</h4>

<p>The Master's of Science in Computer Science degree is intended to
add depth in computer science to an undergraduate degree. Many
students use a Master's degree to further an existing career as a
computer professional; others use the program as an opportunity to
change career paths. Many of these students have majors in disciplines
other than computer science; students with particularly weak computer
science background will be required to take additional courses before
being accepted into the Master's program. Each student will be
evaluated regarding additional courses (in addition to the MS degree
requirements) to be taken. These additional course requirements are
detailed in the acceptence letter from the graduate college.</p>

<h5>Core Course Requirement</h5>

<p>The degree program can be completed with one of the three options
(thesis, project, and coursework, see below). Regardless of the option
chosen, all Master's students are expected to complete the following
three courses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CS201 Operating Systems</li>
  <li>CS224 Analysis of Algorithms</li>
  <li>CS243 Theory of Computation</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on a student's background, the Graduate Committee may grant a
student a waiver from some or all of these course requirements. In the
case of a waiver, a replacement course needs to be approved by the
student's advisor and the Graduate Committee.</p>

<h5>Comprehensive Exams</h5>

<p>Each student must pass a comprehensive exam before graduating,
regardless of the option chosen. A complete description can be found
from the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=grad/comp-exams-guidelines.php&SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">CS
comprehensive exam guidelines</a>. </p>

<p>Each student who needs to take comprehensive oral exams according
to the guidelines should arrange a schedule with the examiners and
then inform the Graduate Committee of the exam date. It is strongly
recommended that the examination is completed during the academic
year, unless all examiners agree to give the exam on a date during the
break.</p>

<p>Students must enroll in GRAD 397: Master`s Comprehensive
Examination prior to taking the comprehensive examination or being
considered to have passed the exam. There is no fee. A grade of
&quot;S&quot; or &quot;U&quot; is recorded.</p>

<h5>Credit Transfer</h5>

<p>With approval of the Graduate Committee, up to 9 credit hours of
course work in Computer Science (or a closely related field) may be
transferred into the Master's degree. Only credits that have not been
used for other degrees (Bachelor's, Master's, or others) are
considered. Note that these credits include any courses taken at UVM
before enrolling in the Master's program and any courses taken at
other institutions, whether before or after enrolling at UVM. In
addition, with the approval of the Graduate Committee, a student may
apply courses in a closely related field taken at the graduate level
while in residence at UVM to their Master's requirements.</p>

<p><em>Note that transfer and waiver are two different, independent
concepts.</em> A transfer means that the transferred credits are
counted towards your Master's degree at UVM, while a waiver only means
that one of the five <em>required</em> courses is replaced by some
other courses (possibly transferred ones).</p> <p>Also, please note
that the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=grad/ms-guide.php&SM=grad/_gradmenu.html#amp">Accelerated
Master's Program (AMP)</a> (see below) is an exception to this
9-credit-transfer rule.</p>

<h5>Academic Standing</h5>

<p>To remain in good standing, students must continue to make
reasonable progress towards completing their degree requirements. To
measure this progress, three requirements are placed on all Master's
students:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Time limit.</b> All full-time students (taking at least 15
credits/year) must complete their degree within 3 years of
enrollment. Part-time students must complete their degree with 5 years
of enrollment. Extensions may be awarded for extraordinary extenuating
circumstances, at the discretion of the Graduate Committee.</li>

<li><b>Grades in individual courses.</b> Any grade of B- or worse is
unacceptable for a Master's student. Upon receipt of a second (or any
subsequent) unacceptable grade, the student's progress will be
reviewed by the Graduate Committee. The Graduate Committee may choose
to impose sanctions on the student, including requiring an additional
course or dismissing the student from the program.</li>

<li><b>Accumulative grade point average (GPA).</b> Every Master's
student must maintain a 3.0 (B) GPA at all times. Any student falling
below a 3.0 will be placed on academic probation and their progress
will be reviewed by the Graduate Committee, with the possible
imposition of sanctions. Furthermore, no student whose final GPA is
below 3.0 will be allowed to graduate.</li> 
</ul>

<h5>Thesis Option</h5>

<p>Students choosing the thesis option must complete a minimum of 30
credit hours, including minimum 21 credits of coursework and 6 credits
of thesis research.</p>

<p>A Master's thesis consists of original research work done under the
guidance of a faculty member. Students opting to pursue a thesis must
select a thesis advisor who agrees to supervise that student's thesis
work. The thesis advisor may be any graduate faculty member who holds
either a primary or a secondary appointment from the Department.</p>

<p>Full-time students should normally choose a thesis advisor by the
end of their first semester. Prior to the selection of a thesis
advisor, a member of the Graduate Committee serves as the student's
advisor (see the Director of Graduate Studies for details).</p>

<p>Each thesis student must write a thesis describing their
research. The thesis is presented before a thesis committee in a
public oral thesis defense. The thesis committee must include three
different individuals: (1) the student's thesis advisor (see below),
(2) another graduate faculty member of the department, and (3) the
chair of the thesis committee. The chair of the thesis committee must
be a member of the graduate faculty without an appointment (either
primary or secondary) in the department.</p>

<p>At least three weeks before the defense, the written thesis must be
submitted to the Graduate College for a format check. At least two
weeks before the defense, the student must make copies of the written
thesis available to all members of the thesis committee. The thesis
defense itself must be adequately advertised to the community. 

<h5>Project Option</h5>

<p>Students choosing the project option must complete a minimum of 30
credit hours, including minimum 24 credits of coursework and 3 credits
of project (CS392). </p>

<p>A graduate project typically consists of a significant
implementation done under the guidance of a faculty member. Students
opting to pursue a project must select an advisor who agrees to
supervise that student's work. The advisor may be any faculty member
who holds either a primary or a secondary appointment from the
Department.</p>

<p>Full-time students should normally choose a project advisor by the
end of their first semester. Prior to the selection of an advisor, a
member of the Graduate Committee serves as the student's advisor (see
the Director of Graduate Studies for details).</p>

<p>The results of the project are presented before a project committee
in a public talk, which has been advertised to the community. The
project committee must include three individuals, at least two of whom
must hold appointments in the department. The chair, who may be the
project advisor, must be a member of the Graduate College and hold an
appointment in the department. The composition of the committee must
be approved by the Graduate Committee.</p>

<p>One bound copy of the project report should be submitted to the
Graduate Program Director within 30 days after the defense. The
submitted copy will be archived in the departmental file. </P>

<p>Documents needed to complete a project defense comprise the project
report, acceptance page, and the exam result. Templates of these
documents can be downloaded from the following links: <a

<h5>Coursework Option</h5>

<p>Students choosing a coursework option must complete a minimum of 30
credit hours of course work. </em></p>

<br />

<h4>Advisors and Their Research Interests</h4>

<p>Your Master's advisor serves as your mentor during your graduate
training. It is important that you feel comfortable discussing issues
with your advisor.</p>

<p>An advisor will be assigned to you when you initially enroll in the
program. Typically, your initial advisor will be the <a href=http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=grad/ms-guide.php&SM=grad/_gradmenu.html#gradcoord>Director of Graduate Studies</a>. You
may request a change of advisor at any time, if you feel that another
graduate faculty member would better serve your needs. The new advisor
must agree to the change.</p>

<p>Thesis students must select a thesis advisor from among the
graduate faculty of the Department. The thesis advisor also serves as
the student's overall advisor (and thus replaces the initial advisor
or other advisors). Also, the chosen thesis advisor must agree to
serve as such.</p>

<p>Students should choose a thesis advisor based on three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>common interest in a research problem,</li>
<li>comfortable working relationship, and</li>
<li>willingness of the advisor to advise the student.</li>
</ul>

<p>Students considering taking the thesis option should meet with all
potential advisors early in their graduate studies. Talk about
potential thesis topics to see if that person's work interests
you. Also try to see whether you would be comfortable working with
that person. The potential advisor should tell you whether they are
willing to take you on as a thesis student.</p>

<h4>Courses and Offering Frequencies</h4>
<p>The Department offers 200-level courses, which are taken both by advanced undergraduate students and graduate students. Students taking 200-level courses for graduate credit typically need to do additional work, frequently a project or class presentation. The Department also offers 300-level courses, which are open only to graduate students.</p>

<p>For the description of each course and its offering frequency in
the past, see our official course listing at <a
