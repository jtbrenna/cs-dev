<h1>Graduate Research Assistantship Available</h1>
<p>
We are recruiting a Graduate Research Assistant on computational biology, statistical genetics or related interdisciplinary areas. Any CS Ph.D. students who are interested in the field are encouraged to apply. 
<p>
Our long-term research goals are to identify genes and genetic causal variants that predispose an individual to complex human diseases, particularly mental disorders, with the ultimate goal of informing intervention and treatment approaches. Our central hypothesis is that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs), and other genomic variations in the human genome contribute to disease heritability, and that environmental triggers modulate the association patterns of the genetic variants. We use new high-throughput genetic and genomic experiments (e.g., microarrays and next-generation sequencing) and computational tools with emphasis on analytic aspects and new approach/tool development. The research projects for the CS students include the development of a statistical/computational method/software or application of these tools into our real genome-wide SNP and CNV data from patient cohorts. 
<p>
We are looking for dedicated students who are motivated in the research, understand the significance of scientific publications, and are enthusiastic to build up his or her academic career in this exciting, sunrise field. The ideal candidate will be (1) strong in computer programming or biostatistics, (2) with basic knowledge on human genetics, particularly, the human genome and big genetic data.
