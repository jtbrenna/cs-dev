<p><strong>Summary</strong>
<br />
Object recognition is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision. One of the main difficulties is in developing representations that can effectively capture typical variations in appearance within a large class of objects. Deformable models provide a natural approach for addressing this problem. While deformable models provide an elegant framework for representing a variety of objects, they also lead to difficult computation problems.

<p>
In the first part of the talk I will describe efficient algorithms we have developed for finding objects in images using different types of deformable models. In the second part of the talk I will consider the specific problem of detecting and localizing objects of a generic category, such as people or cars, in cluttered images. We have recently developed a new
multiscale deformable part model for solving this problem. The models are trained with a discriminative procedure, using a formalism we call "latent SVM." We have used these models to implement an object detection system that is both highly efficient and accurate, processing an image in about 2 seconds and achieving recognition rates that are significantly better than previous systems.</p>
