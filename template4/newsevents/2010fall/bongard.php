        Dr. Joshua Bongard has been named the recipient of a National
Science Foundation CAREER Award by Division of Information &amp;
Intelligent Systems.
        This prestigious award, in the amount of approximately $310,000,
supports the early career-development activities of those teacher-scholars
who most
        effectively integrate research and education within the context of
the mission of their organization.

        "We are proud of the research being accomplished on AI and complex
systems by Dr. Bongard," says Bernard "Chip" Cole, Interim Dean, UVM
College of
        Engineering and Mathematical Sciences. "This recognition reflects
the high quality of innovative research done within our College."
    </p>

        Bongard's research has received national and international
recognition. He received the prestigious and highly competitive New Faculty
Fellowship from
        Microsoft Research in 2007 for his robotics research with
self-healing robots. Only five such awards are given nation-wide. He also
received
        recognition from MIT as one of the world's top innovators under 35
as well as participation in a National Academy of Engineering symposium to
discuss
        21<sup>st</sup> century frontiers in research.

        "This research is an alternative approach to robotics and biology,"
says Bongard. "The research will allow undergraduate, graduate as well as
high
        school students to design novel virtual environments in which
robots must evolve."

        <strong>ABSTRACT</strong>
        <br/>

   
        To date, relatively little success has been achieved in realizing
machines that continually perform simple yet adaptive behaviors in
unstructured
        environments (compared to a structured environment such as a
factory). The prevailing approach to create such machines is to copy
physiological and
        neurological systems observed in animals, and build them into
robots. This raises the issue however of what from among the infinitude of
existing
        biological structures should be copied. Research under this award
is pursuing an alternative approach: rather than copy existing biological
systems,
        evolutionary dynamics are copied and connected in a virtual space.
The resulting evolutionary algorithm optimizes virtual robots'
neurological
        structures that control behavior and their body plans. Importantly,
evolution in these studies is task and behavior specific.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The research is intended to make important contributions to
robotics and biology. For roboticists, this work will enable computers to
automatically
        design the body plans and neural controllers for robots that are
more adaptive and robust than robots designed manually.
Automatically-designed virtual
        robots can then be built as physical devices and deployed into
real-world environments, including those that are dangerous to humans. For
biologists,
        our studies will provide insight into why and how particular
structures evolved in nature. For example, if legged robots originally
evolved for
        locomotion are then selected to locomote and grasp objects,
computational evolution may re-purpose the robot's front legs into arms and
grippers; or,
        it may add manipulatory appendages onto the existing body plan.
Either outcome would be of great interest to evolutionary biologists.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Finally, experiments are being housed in online tools that will
allow graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students to run evolutionary
simulations
        passively on their own machines, as well as actively participate in
the process: they may design novel virtual environments in which the robots
must
        evolve. This active participation is intended to motivate students
to understand the physics, biology, engineering and computational
processes
        underlying evolution.
