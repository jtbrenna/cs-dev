<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
Recent advances in network science have generated much progress in our understanding of the structure and function of many networked systems, ranging from transportation networks, to social networks, the internet, ecosystems, and biochemical and gene transcription pathways.  Network approaches are also beginning to be applied to the brain, at several levels of scale from cells to entire brain systems.  We now know that brain networks exhibit a number of characteristic topological features, including small-world attributes, modularity, and hubs.  These network features can be related to brain dynamics and global performance in cognition and behavior.  I will review recent work on how complex brain networks are organized, and how their topology constrains and shapes their capacity to process and integrate information.  Particular emphasis will be on the structure of the human brain and on what this structure can possibly tell us about human cognition.

<p><strong>Speaker Bio</strong>
<br />
Olaf Sporns received a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Rockefeller University (New York) and conducted postdoctoral work at The Neurosciences Institute in New York and San Diego.  Currently he is Professor and Associate Chair in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and a member of the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at Indiana University in Bloomington.  His main research area is theoretical and computational neuroscience, with an emphasis on network complexity, brain connectivity, and neurorobotics.
