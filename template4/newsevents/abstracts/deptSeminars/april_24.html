  <p>This talk introduces a novel mathematical technique called the cell-graphs
  to represent and quantify the information encoded in a tissue sample. The
  cell-graphs are generated from the low-cost, low-magnification tissue images
  according to the spatial distribution of the cells. The mathematical
  properties of cell-graphs provide a set of features that can be used by
  machine learning techniques to characterize the properties of the underlying
  tissue.</p>
  <p>It is shown that cell-graph approach leads to successful tissue diagnosis
  of a brain cancer called &quot;malignant glioma&quot;. The cell-graph approach
  can also be used decision support system in several other areas including
  tissue engineering, measurement of drug responsiveness, and other types of
  cancer diagnosis and prognostication. In this talk we will first present the
  techniques to obtain cell-graphs of glioma and discuss future work.</p>
  <p>Joint work with Cigdem Demir (RPI) and Hume Gultekin (OHSU).</p>
