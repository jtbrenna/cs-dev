<p><strong>Summary</strong>
<br />
I first present a simple model of one or more populations whose members give birth to new organisms that settle nearby, and die at a rate to keep the population constant. This model exhibits coarsening (i.e., growth of clusters) that leads to a steady state with fractal spatial structures and other nontrivial properties. With populations of two or more species, one observes phase separation. The second part explores some of the biological implications of such a spatial population structure, compared to a well-mixed population. Spatial proximity leads to inbreeding, which has a strong impact on the fate of recessive mutations, both beneficial and deleterious; the odds of fixation for dominant mutations remain constant.
