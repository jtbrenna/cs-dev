<p><strong>Summary</strong>
<br />
An important goal of human genetics is to understand the role of genes in predicting the initiation, progression, and severity of common diseases such as breast cancer and hypertension.  Will one or more of the 30,000 genes in the human genome predict your risk of having a heart attack above and beyond information about your diet and exercise patterns?  This is an exciting time in human genetics because we now have access to technologies that make it feasible to measure thousands of DNA sequence variations across the human genome.  The challenge for geneticists is to sift through the massive amounts of information to determine which specific DNA sequence variations play an important role in disease susceptibility.  The purpose of this talk is to communicate the important role that computer science will play in turning data into clinically useful knowledge.
