<h3>Undergraduate Programs</h3>

<p>
The Department of Computer Science offers three options for undergraduate degrees:
</p>
<ul class="spacey">
<li><a href="../?Page=undergrad/bscs.php&SM=undergrad/_undergradmenu.html">Bachelor of Science, Major in Computer Science, BS(CS)</a></li>
<li><a href="../?Page=undergrad/bscsis.php&amp;SM=undergrad/_undergradmenu.html">Bachelor of Science, Major in Computer Science and Information Systems, BS(CSIS)</a></li>
<li><a href="../?Page=undergrad/bacs.php&amp;SM=undergrad/_undergradmenu.html">Bachelor of Arts, Major in Computer Science, BA(CS)
College of Arts and Sciences</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Department also offers an <a href="../?Page=grad/amp.php&amp;SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">Accelerated Master's Program (AMP)</a>, which qualified undergraduates may enter at the end of their junior year and work toward both BS and MS degrees simultaneously.
</p>

<h4>Which Major is for you?</h4>
<p>
It may be hard to know whether you want a Computer Science program that is oriented towards science, mathematics and engineering (the BS[CS] program), one oriented towards business and information technology (the BS[CSIS] program), or one that is more flexible and oriented towards the arts, social sciences and humanities (the BA[CS] program).
</p>
<p>
For a brief overview of the differences between these programs, see <A href="ataglance.pdf">CS Majors at a Glance (.pdf)</a>.
</p>

<h5>Not sure?</h5>
<p>
You can make your course selections so that you can delay the decision. If you don't know which program is for you, we suggest taking:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Semester 1: CS 21, MATH 21, CHEM 31, ECON 11</li>
<li>Semester 2: CS 110, MATH 22, CHEM 32 or BIO 2, ECON 12</li>
</ul>
<p>
See a CS advisor for help in keeping your options open, and in deciding which CS program is for you.
