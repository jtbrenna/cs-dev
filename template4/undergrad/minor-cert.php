<h4>Certificate in Computer Software</h4>
<p>
The Department of Computer Science and the Division of Continuing Education offer a non-degree <a href="http://learn.uvm.edu/business-2/certificate-programs/certificate-in-computer-software">Certificate in Computer Software</a> that requires five courses (at least 15 credits) in approved CS courses at UVM.
</p>
<p>
The certificate program offers a flexible selection of courses to meet individual needs. For example, one can design a program in preparation for admission to the Master of Science program for students whose undergraduate degree is from another academic discipline.
