Evolutionary and Agent-Based Computing</h3>

<p>Computer Science faculty members and their graduate students are actively involved in a variety of research projects focusing on systems of autonomous and/or evolving agents.</p>

<p>Some of this research focuses on developing and studying computational intelligence using nature-inspired computing paradigms, such as evolutionary computation, artificial neural networks, and autonomously interacting computational agents.  Other projects are focused on applying these methods to domain-specific problems in areas such as robotics, biology, ecology, economics, social networks, psychology, and transportation.</p>

<p>The general area of Evolutionary and Agent-Based Computing has strong overlaps with our other departmental focus areas in <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=research/datamining/default.php&amp;SM=research/_researchmenu.html">Data Mining</a> and <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=research/distrsys.php&amp;SM=research/_researchmenu.html">Distributed Systems</a>, and supports the College thrust in <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cmplxsys/">Complex Systems</a>.</p>
