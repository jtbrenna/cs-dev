<h4>Guidelines for Distribution of Professional Development Funds</h4>

<p>Below are the Department of Computer Science guidelines finalized in Spring 2003 for distribution of professional development funds:</p>

<ul class="spacey"> 

<li>Each faculty member will get $250 to spend on their own professional development activities. The receipts for the $250 are subject to the University Finance Department's approval for reimbursement.  Legitimate expenses include journal subscriptions, professional memberships and books/conference proceedings.</li>

<li>The remaining funds from the departmental professional development account will be used as a central pool for everyone to apply. Most (if not all) of these funds will be used to support travel expenses.  A faculty member can get up to $2,500 from these funds.</li>

<li>Requests for funds from the central pool must be sent to the Chair before October 1.</li>

<li>On May 1, all non encumbered funds will be available for re-distribution. The re-distribution will be in reverse order of how much the faculty member has already received (the total will most likely be less than $800 if no trip was taken.)</li>

</ul>

<p>The Chair is prepared to provide additional travel support from the departmental operating budget subject to (1) the importance of such a need, and (2) available funds in the operating budget.</p>
