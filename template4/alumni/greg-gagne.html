Greg Gagne earned an M.S. in Computer Science from UVM in 1990 and moved to Salt Lake City where he is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Westminster College. Greg credits his graduate education at UVM for introducing him to his two professional interests: operating systems and teaching. 
<p>
Greg took CS 201 Operating Systems his first semester at UVM and discovered a field of study that remains to this day his primary interest in computer science. He credits that course as one of the first learning experiences where he found the material challenging, engaging, and fun. It was a blend of theory, practice, and common sense and he feels these traits continue in successful, contemporary technology. Additionally, it was in CS 201 that he was introduced to the notion of concurrent programming, a topic which at the time seemed relatively important, but is now crucial in this age of multicore and manycore systems. His recollections of writing UNIX, as well as concurrent, programs late at night in Votey remain a vivid memory. Greg has co-authored the classic operating system text "Operating System Concepts" which is now in its Ninth edition. This text has been used in CS 201 at UVM and if you have used it, you may noticed the embedded references to both UVM and Vermont throughout!

Although Greg entered graduate school with the hopes of working at a research laboratory in industry, things quickly changed when he began working as a graduate teaching fellow for CS 2 and CS 3 where he discovered a passion for teaching.  Greg began his teaching career at Westminster College and is thankful for his graduate teaching experiences for exposing him to directly working with students and the passion he discovered for helping non-majors master technical skills. He has authored several papers and presented them at conferences and workshops, all with a relationship to teaching and learning.

Greg resides in Salt Lake City, Utah with his wife and two sons. When he's not working, you can find him backcountry skiing, trail running, or rock climbing. He welcomes any communication via ggagne@westminstercollege.edu or @greg_gagne
