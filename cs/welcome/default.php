<h1>SHAPE THE FUTURE -- Consider Computing at UVM!</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href=http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~meppstei target=_blank><img style="float:right; margin-left: 10px;" src=MaggieHeadshotJan2012Color.jpg height=200></a>This is an amazing time to go into computing, with unprecedented opportunities. Computers are a ubiquitous and growing presence in all
aspects of modern society, and thus there is <a href=http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~meppstei/CSDemand.jpg target=_blank>huge and increasing
demand</a> for computing professionals that is <a href=http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~meppstei/CSsupply.jpg target=_blank>far from being met</a>
 by the profile of today's graduates.
This is why unemployment is near zero for Computing Professionals who want to work, and Computing Professionals earn some of
the <a href=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm target=_blank>highest salaries</a> in
the U.S. But it's not just the money and jobs that make Computing such an exciting profession - Computing-related careers are some of
the most <a href=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-7 target=_blank>versatile</a>, creative,
and satisfying career choices you can make, and computational thinking and skills are valuable complements to virtually all other
career areas.

Whether your passion is to help fight global warming, uncover the secrets of the human genome, create intelligent robots, bring
history alive through mobile apps, prevent terrorism, understand human social phenomena, play the stock market, create digital art,
improve health care, or invent the technologies of the future, computing is central to these and most modern endeavors.  Computing
professionals often collaborate in teams but may also work individually; they may be entrepreneurs, telecommuters, consultants,
academics, work in a small business, work in a big business, work in a national laboratory, work in government, or work internationally.  
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Whether you are interested in computing as a first or second major, a minor, or just want to take a course or two,
<a href=http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs target=_blank>University of Vermont Computer Science</a> has something to offer.  Our dedicated
<a href=http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=employee/facstaff.php&SM=employee/_employeemenu.html target=_blank>lecturers and world-class research faculty</a> offer dozens of courses ranging from introductory courses in WWW design, mobile
app development, and computer programming in a variety of languages to advanced courses in areas such as evolutionary robotics,
agent-based computing, data mining, machine learning, cryptography, bioinformatics and lots in between.
