University of Vermont!</span>

<p>

Computer Science is a research-oriented department that aspires to be
a center of excellence in teaching computer science at all levels,
emphasizing both long-term academic preparation and shorter-term
economic importance, as well as excellence in research and graduate
education by developing strengths in a small number of focused
research areas and by exploiting Computer Science's unique
opportunities for collaboration with other strong research areas at
the University.

</p>

<p>

Our curriculum provides a broad basic training in Computer Science,
with required courses in the theory of computing, computer
organization, and software techniques.  At the undergraduate level, we
offer three programs leading to Bachelor's degrees:

</p> 

<ul>
<li> 
<a
href="../?Page=undergrad/bscs.php&amp;SM=undergrad/_undergradmenu.html">Bachelor
of Science, Major in Computer Science</a> &mdash; <i>our most
technical program in computer science complemented with physical
sciences and mathematics</i>;</li> 
<li> <a
href="../?Page=undergrad/bscsis.php&amp;SM=undergrad/_undergradmenu.html">Bachelor
of Science, Major in Computer Science and Information Systems</a>
&mdash; <i>an interdisciplinary major combining computer science and
business administration</i>; </li>

<li>
<a
href="../?Page=undergrad/bacs.php&amp;SM=undergrad/_undergradmenu.html">Bachelor
of Arts, Major in Computer Science</a>, in the College of Arts and
Sciences &mdash; <i>a flexible program providing computer science in
the context of a liberal arts degree, allowing a wide range of double
majors and minors</i>.  
</li>

</ul>
<p>
At the graduate level, we also offer three programs through the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~gradcoll/" target="_top">Graduate
College</a>: two leading to a Master of Science (MS) degree and an
interdisciplinary PhD program.
</p>
<ul>

<li> The <a
href="../?Page=grad/ms.php&amp;SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">Master's
Program</a> is a traditional two-year degree program, which offers
both a thesis, and a nonthesis option.

<li> The <a
href="../?Page=grad/amp.php&amp;SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">Accelerated
Master's Program (AMP)</a> enables exceptionally motivated students to
complete both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science
within a five year period.

<li> The <a
href="../?Page=grad/phd.php&amp;SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">interdisciplinary
PhD program in Computer Science</a> offers study in both traditional
and cross-disciplinary areas such as bioinformatics and ecological
modeling, and includes graduate assistantships specifically designated
for students involved in interdisciplinary areas.  

</ul>

<p>
Our faculty in Computer Science is involved in the forefront of
research in intelligent systems with three thrust areas: <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=research/datamining/default.php&amp;SM=research/_researchmenu.html">data
mining</a>, <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=research/distrsys.php&amp;SM=research/_researchmenu.html">distributed
systems</a>, and <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=research/compbio.php&amp;SM=research/_researchmenu.html">evolutionary &amp; agent-based computing</a> that complement University-wide initiatives in
computational sciences, energy/environment, and life sciences, and
contribute towards the college-wide spire of excellence in Complex
Systems in the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences. Our
interdisciplinary work cuts across all areas of campus, with current
emphasis in bioinformatics and ecological modeling.  We publish in
prestigious journals and conferences in Computer Science; have
significant research grants from federal agencies (such as NSF, NIH,
DOD, and DOE); serve on first-rate journal editorial boards, top-tier
conference committees, NSF/NIH/DOE review panels, and leading
professional societies; and have won international society awards.
<p>
I would like to invite all Computer Science students (both
undergraduate and graduate) to join the <a
href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~cssa" target="_top">Computer Science
Student Association (CSSA)</a>.  The CSSA organizes its own seminars,
public service activities, receptions and picnics for new students,
and frequently articulates the student point-of-view for departmental
issues.  Socially, it serves the Department by providing a sense of
community for our students, and allows for students from different
years to become acquainted with each other.
