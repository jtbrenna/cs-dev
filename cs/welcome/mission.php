<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>The Department of Computer Science upholds and strengthens the mission of the   University of Vermont towards the provision of innovation in research and   scholarship, excellence in instruction, and public service to the citizens of   the state, nation and world. The principal mission of the Department is to   create and share knowledge relevant to the discipline of computer science. It   seeks to: </p>

<ol class="spacey">
<li>Provide innovative, relevant, interesting and academically sound courses   with three foci &mdash; graduate degree programs, undergraduate degree programs, and service courses. 

   <ol class="alpha">
   <li>The graduate programs are essential to the Department's responsibility to   create and share innovative knowledge. Our graduate programs aim to teach   students how to extend the frontiers of computer science knowledge, and the goal   of our Ph.D. program is to provide students with the opportunity to become   innovative scholars.</li>
   <li>At the undergraduate level, the Department provides both a B.A. program and   a B.S. program, and the B.S. in Computer Science program hosts major   concentrations in both Computer Science, and Computer Science and Information   Systems. The undergraduate programs aim to (1) teach students how to use   computers effectively, creatively, and intelligently; (2) teach computer science   as a multifaceted, humanistic discipline; (3) teach the technical and scientific   knowledge needed for the professional and academic goals of our students; and   (4) teach students how to acquire new knowledge, independently, in a world that   changes with ever increasing rapidity.</li>
   <li>With service courses, the Department feels responsible to provide each   student at the University of Vermont with an opportunity to learn the basic   concepts and practical skills of computer science. As computers become more   ubiquitous in society, it is essential for every student to understand the   capabilities and limitations of practical computers, and how to resolve the   numerous ethical issues that involve computers and information.</li>
  </ol>
   
   </li>
   
   <li>Encourage a strong interaction with related disciplines in business,   engineering, medicine, mathematics, and the physical and biological sciences; </li>
   <li>Focus our graduate programs and maintain a strong presence internationally   at the research frontier in Computer Science on a small number of research foci   that depend on the strengths and interests of the graduate faculty. 

   <ol class="alpha">
      <li>As computer science is a rapidly evolving discipline, innovative research   including interdisciplinary scholarship that creates knowledge and extends the   scope of computer science, is especially encouraged.</li>
      <li>Publications in computer science journals and conferences that share our   research expertise, are strongly supported.</li>
      <li>Professional services and research funding that are useful for research   including scholarship and publications and for knowledge sharing, are highly   promoted.</li>
  </ol>

   <li>Provide a collegial and professional environment for students, staff,   faculty, and visitors that is conducive to learning, teaching, scholarship,   research and service.</li>
</ol>
