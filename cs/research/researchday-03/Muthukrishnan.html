<h3 align="center">ABSTRACT</h3>
<p align="left">There is a rich theory of metric space embeddings; these methods are now being applied to algorithms that deal with super-fast
data streams. I will describe such applications in spaces that deal with vectors, strings and trees. These algorithms have applications
in database systems, networking and computational biology.  </p>

        Muthukrishnan</a> graduated from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU, with PhD work in pattern matching algorithms and
        probabilistic games. Since then he has been at U. Warwick, UK, Bell Labs, AT&amp;T Research and Rutgers Univ. His research interest is
        generally in Algorithms applied to Databases, Networking, Wireless Systems, Scheduling and Computational Biology. His current interest
        is in massive data set analysis and data streaming algorithms. See webpage
