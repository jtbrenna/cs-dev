<h4>223. Criteria in Appointment, Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure
Decisions.</h4>

<b>223.1</b> General Considerations. In considering candidates for
appointment, reappointment, promotion, and/or tenure, each candidate
will be judged with respect to the proposed rank, status, and duties,
considering his or her record of performance in teaching, research or
other creative work, and service. The following subsections provide a
framework of criteria and standards of evaluation within which
judgments are made on the present achievements and future potential of
the candidate.

<p>

In evaluating the candidate's qualifications within these three areas,
reasonable flexibility shall be exercised, balancing, where the case
requires, heavier assignments and responsibilities in one area against
lighter assignments and responsibilities in another. Each candidate is
expected to be engaged in a program of work which is sound and
productive and which can be expected to continue to develop throughout
his or her professional career. In all instances, excellent
intellectual attainment, in accordance with the criteria set forth
below, is the crucial qualification for appointment or promotion to a
tenured position. Insistence upon this standard for continuing members
of the faculty is necessary for maintenance of quality of the
University as an institution dedicated to the discovery, preservation,
and transmission of knowledge.

<p>

<b>223.2</b> Teaching. Effective teaching is an essential criterion
for initial appointment as an associate professor or professor, for
reappointment at any rank, or for tenure or promotion.

<p>

The prime requisites for an effective teacher are intellectual
competence, integrity, and independence; a willingness and capacity to
grow in the field, to consider suggestions and to cooperate in
teaching activities; a spirit of scholarly inquiry which leads to the
strengthening of both course content and presentation in light of
developments in the discipline; a vital interest in teaching and
working with students, and, above all, the ability to stimulate their
intellectual interest and enthusiasm; a capacity to awaken in students
an awareness of the relationship of the subject to other fields of
knowledge; an interest and skill in the general guidance and academic
advising of students. Academic advising of students is an important
part of the mission of the University. Many faculty members perform
this function. For these faculty members academic advising will be
considered as part of the total teaching effort.

<p>

Teaching and academic advising must be evaluated regularly and the
results of such evaluation must be presented systematically and
considered in reappointment, promotion, and tenure decisions.

<p>

Elaboration: No single set of satisfactory measures can be
prescribed. However, significant evidence for the evaluation of
teaching can be derived from some combination of the following (not
rank ordered): (1) opinions of members of the candidate's department,
particularly if based on examination of course materials, on team
teaching experiences, on class visitations, on attendance at lectures
given by the candidate or on the results of the candidate's teaching
in courses prerequisite to those of other members of the department;
(2) opinions of students, appropriately documented and interpreted,
for example, through the use of student survey instruments and/or by
seeking evaluation by students after course completion or after
graduation; (3) development by the candidate of new and effective
techniques of instruction and instructional materials, including
textbooks, particularly when evidenced by acceptance at other
universities; (4) publications by the candidate on the teaching of
his/her discipline in respected journals; and (5) recognitions or
awards for distinguished teaching.

<p>

<b>223.3</b> Research, Scholarship, and Creative Work. There must be
evidence that the candidate is continuously and effectively engaged in
scholarly activity of high quality and significance.  Account shall be
taken of the type and quality of creative activity normally expected
in the candidate's field. Documented evidence must be provided of
genuine scholarship, productivity, and creativity in the form of such
things as published research or recognized artistic production, or
engineering designs, etc.

<p>

Teaching and scholarship go hand in hand. An institution of recognized
quality must foster an environment which promotes scholarship and
teaching in a mutually supportive relationship.

<p>

Publication of research and other creative accomplishment must be
evaluated, not merely enumerated.

<p>

Elaboration: Work in progress should be assessed whenever
possible. When published work in joint authorship (or other product of
joint effort) is considered, it is the responsibility of the
department to establish as clearly as possible the role of the
candidate in the joint effort.

<p>

Appraisals of publication or other works in the scholarly and critical
literature may provide important testimony.

<p>

If the record of the candidate includes journal articles, it is the
responsibility of the chairperson to communicate clear information
concerning the publication and review standards of the journal and its
standing in the discipline.

<p>

If the record of the candidate includes publication of a monograph or
monographs, it is the responsibility of the chairperson to communicate
clear information about the reviewing policies of the press and to
report reviews published subsequent to the appearance of the work.

<p>

In cases involving tenure or promotion to associate professor or
professor, the quality and significance of the work must be evaluated
by the department. In addition, the department must solicit
evaluations from acknowledged scholars or practitioners at other
institutions.

<p>

If the record of the candidate includes presentations, invited and/or
subject to peer evaluation, it is the responsibility of the
chairperson to communicate clear information concerning the standards
involved.

<p>

In certain disciplines in which competitive grant and contract support
is available, a record of continuing support may be an indication of
recognized research competence and productivity.

<p>

Textbooks, reports, and similar products connected with teaching or
public service should be considered creative work insofar as they
present new ideas or incorporate the candidate's scholarly research.

<p>

In certain fields such as art, music, literature, and theatre,
distinguished production may be evidence of scholarship in much the
same way as analytical research is in other disciplines. In evaluating
artistic creativity, an attempt should be made to define the
candidate's merit in the light of such criteria as originality, scope,
and depth of creative expression.

<p>

In some instances, professional activities, such as service as editor
of a professional journal or service as a major officer of a
professional organization, may be considered as recognition of
scholarly achievement.

<p>

<b>223.4</b> Service. Service by all members of the faculty in their
capacity as scholars is an essential part of the University's mission.

<p>

The faculty plays a vital role in the governance of the University at
all levels and in the formulation of its policies. Effective service
in this regard is expected of all faculty members.  Recognition should
be given to scholars who participate effectively and imaginatively in
faculty governance and the formulation of departmental,
college/school, and University policies. Similarly, contributions to
student welfare through service on student-faculty committees, as
advisor to student organizations, or as a contributor to the promotion
of cultural pluralism of the University should be considered. Such
contributions may include participation in programs on awareness of
discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, gender, sexual
orientation, religion, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital
status, handicap, or political affiliations and beliefs; involvement
in campus efforts to promote cultural diversity, or in the promotion
of affirmative action.

<p>

Some persons may demonstrate their service contributions through
effective participation on the community, state, or national
professional level, e.g. through service on accreditation teams, as a
contributor to the promotion of cultural pluralism, as an officer of a
professional organization, as a professional consultant, etc.

<p>

In certain of the colleges and schools, a demonstrated distinction in
service responsibilities characteristic of the area may be an
essential criterion for appointment, reappointment, promotion, and/or
tenure. Examples include extension work (agriculture, home economics,
and natural resources), clinical practice (health disciplines), and
field service (education).

<p>

Elaboration: All of the candidate's professional service activities
should be scrutinized for evidence of achievement and of leadership in
the field and in the development or utilization of new approaches and
techniques for the solution of professional problems. Evidence must be
provided of the quality of the service rendered, including evaluations
by persons or agencies served.
