<a name="Introduction">
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

In accordance with the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~provost/acadunionagrmt.pdf">Agreement
Between the University of Vermont and United Academics (AAUP/AFT)</a>
(referred to as the Union Contract hereafter), this document is
developed to provide reappointment and promotion guidelines for
research faculty in the Department of Computer Science.
<p>

According to the Union Contract, "each faculty member is expected to
engage continuously and effectively in creative professional
activities of high quality and significance."  All research faculty
members must provide evidence in this regard for their reappointment
and promotion reviews.

<p>

Publication of refereed articles in both journals and conferences is
very important; in some areas of computer science, publication in
top-tier conferences is considered as prestigious as publication in
top journals.  Acquisition of competitive grant and contract support
is considered an indication of recognized research competence and
productivity.  Similarly, invited lectures or publications, journal
editorship, or service as a major officer in a professional society,
may be considered as recognition of scholarly achievement.  Patents,
software products, monographs, book chapters, unpublished conference
presentations, and other products of scholarly activity may also be
considered.

<p>

For peer-reviewed journal publications, the candidate is advised to
provide information regarding the standards of the journal and its
standing in the discipline. For conference proceedings, the candidate
is asked to distinguish the level of peer-review (fully-refereed,
abstract-refereed, non-refereed) and to provide information about the
conference acceptance rates, if possible.  For monographs and book
chapters, the candidate is advised to provide information regarding
the review process of the press, and whether or not the work was
invited.  Candidates are encouraged to outline the significant
contributions of each major publication.

<p>

<a name="Co-Authors">

Collaborative, interdisciplinary, and cross-disciplinary research is
strongly encouraged.  For joint publications, the candidate should
describe their role in the joint effort.  For all greensheet reviews
for research faculty, the candidate will be asked to provide contact
information for co-authors with whom the candidate has created or
published joint work since the last greensheet review.  These
co-authors will then be invited by the Chair to comment on their
perception of the role of the candidate in their joint work.  For
interdisciplinary or cross-disciplinary work, the candidate is advised
to describe the nature of the publication venue and the relationship
of the research to Computer Science.

<a name="Arm's-Length Evaluators">
<h3>2. Selection of Arm's-Length Evaluators</h3>

For the following research faculty greensheet reviews, "arm's-length"
evaluators will be solicited to provide external reports:

<ul>

<li> promotion to 
Research Associate Professor and Research Professor.

</ul>

Arm's-length evaluators are individuals who do not have a significant
personal relationship with the candidate.  They are not former
students, thesis advisors, former or present colleagues, co-authors,
or collaborators.

<p>

Also, arm's-length evaluators should

<ol> 

<li> Be "acknowledged scholars and practitioners in the discipline of
the candidate at other institutions. These scholars and practitioners
should ... be capable of providing an objective, informed assessment
of the candidate's work." [The Union Contract, Article 15, Clause 4,
Page 30.]
 
<li> Be tenured at their home universities (and for promotion to the
rank of Research Professor, have the same or an equivalent rank), if
they come from academia.

<li> Have expertise in at least one of the candidate's research areas.

</ol>

The Chair will inform the arm's-length reviewers of all pertinent
facts regarding the candidate, with the candidate's representative
publications and other creative work, and will ask them for comments
on

<ul> 
 
<li> the quality of the candidate's research, 
<li> the candidate's research contributions to his/her research field,
<li> the candidate's productivity relative to other 
academics at a similar stage in  their career, 
<li> the candidate's potential as a research leader, and

<li> the publication and review standards of the journals and
conference proceedings in which the candidate has published, and their
standings in the discipline.

</ul> 

<a name="Arm's-Length - Numbers">
<h4>2.1. Numbers of Arm's-Length Evaluators</h5>

<ul> 
 
<li> For promotion to Research Associate Professor, the Chair will
solicit 4 arm's-length evaluations.

<li> For promotion to the rank of Research Professor, the
Chair will solicit 6 arm's-length evaluations.
 
</ul> 

<a name="Arm's-Length - Selection">
<h4>2.2. The Selection Process</h4>

N below refers to the number of arm's-length evaluators that the Chair
will contact for each type of greensheet reviews, as defined in
Section 2.1.

<ol>  
  
<li> The candidate is asked to provide N nominations.

<li> The Chair compiles N other names from other sources.

<li> The Chair shows the N other names to the candidate and asks the
candidate to identify (1) any names that are not at arm'- length, and
(2) any names with whom the candidate has personal/professional
disagreements.

<li> The Chair selects and contacts N names from the combined list,
with at least half from the candidate's list.

<li> In the greensheets for all faculty to review, the Chair will list
these N names and mention who were nominated by the candidate and who
were solicited by the Chair independently.

</ol>  

<a name="Faculty Input and Eligible Voters">
<h3>3. Faculty Input and Eligible Voters for Research Faculty Reviews</h3>

<a name="Faculty Input">
<h4>3.1. Faculty Input and Schedule for Research Faculty Reviews</h5>

The Chair should set an appropriate schedule for each greensheet
review, so that the complete greensheets will be ready for faculty
review <i>at least 2 weeks before the submission deadline to the
Dean's Office</i>.

<p>

Once the greensheets are ready for faculty review, all faculty 
members, tenured and untenured (including tenure-track/tenured 
faculty, research faculty, Lecturers, and Senior Lecturers) will be 
invited to review the greensheets and share their advice concerning 
the candidate with the Chair within a week. The feedback will be 
documented in the Chair's Evaluation. 

<p>

At the beginning of the second week after the greensheets are
complete, the Chair will convene (i) a meeting of all faculty members
to discuss the greensheets, and (ii) a closed session for all eligible
voters (as defined in Section 3.2) to vote on whether or not to
recommend the candidate's application.  This vote will be recorded in
the Chair's Evaluation.

<p>

After the above faculty feedback and eligible voters' vote, the Chair
will decide whether or not to recommend the candidate's application,
and will inform the candidate with a detailed Chair's Evaluation.

<a name="Eligible Voters">
<h4>3.2 Eligible Voters for Research Faculty Reviews</h4>

When a candidate applies for promotion to a particular rank, only
those faculty members who are already at this rank or above are
eligible voters. When a candidate applies for reappointment at a
particular rank, only those faculty members who have successfully
passed their reappointment at this rank and are not applying for
another reappointment in the current year for the same level of
reappointment, are eligible voters.

<ul>

<li> For a research faculty reappointment with a greensheet review,
tenure-track/tenured faculty members at the same rank or above,
research faculty members at a higher rank, and those research faculty
members at the same rank who have successfully passed a greensheet
review at the same rank in the past and are not applying for a
reappointment in the current year, are eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Research Assistant Professor, only
Research Assistant Professors, Research Associate Professors, Research
Professors, Assistant Professors, Associate Professors and Professors
are eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Research Associate Professor, only
Research Associate Professors, Research Professors, Associate
Professors and Professors are eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Research Professor, only
Professors and Research Professors are eligible voters.

</ul>

The Chair is not an eligible voter.  

<a name="Research Promotion">
<h3>4. Promotion to Research Assistant Professor, Research Associate
Professor and Research Professor</h4>

A research faculty member may become a candidate for promotion by
personal request or by recommendation of the Chair (who is the formal
supervisor of each research faculty member in the Department).  Such a
request or recommendation should be discussed in the appropriate May
so that arm's-length evaluators can be organized in the following
summer.

<p>

Research faculty members do not have teaching or service expectations
in the Department, but if the candidate has performed significant
teaching or service work, he/she may choose to include this work in
the promotion greensheets.  

<p>

The candidate's research will be evaluated using the quality criteria
for active research in the Union Contract (Article 15).

<p>

After the Chair's Evaluation in Section 3.1, a candidate for promotion
may choose to withdraw the current application.

<a name="Rebuttal and Appeal">
<h3>5. Rebuttal and Appeal</h3>

After receiving the Chair's Evaluation on a reappointment and
promotion review, the faculty member may rebut or appeal, following
the procedures described in the Union Contract.
