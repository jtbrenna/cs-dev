Between the University of Vermont and United Academics (AAUP/AFT)</a>

  4-6 students&nbsp;for teaching and&nbsp;2-4 students for advising, &nbsp;6-8&nbsp;and 4-6 
  respectively for Senior Lecturer promotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
  the&nbsp;response yield&nbsp;is&nbsp;inadequate,&nbsp; the&nbsp;candidate&nbsp;and the Chair may consult 
  and make additional solicitations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Solicitations&nbsp;and deadlines for responses 
  should be made early in the review process&nbsp;to achieve&nbsp;sufficient 
  yield.&nbsp; 
</a></p><li><a name="Student Selection"> The 
  candidate will provide&nbsp;lists of student
nominations, one&nbsp;for teaching and&nbsp;one for advising (with possible overlaps).&nbsp;&nbsp;

</a><p>

</p><li><a name="Student Selection">           An 
  ad-hoc           committee
will&nbsp;provide student nominations for teaching and advising:

<li>The ad-hoc committee will be formed each academic 
    year for all RPT candidates.
    <LI>The ad-hoc committee will consist of at least two members.<li><a name="Student Selection">  The Department Office will provide (i) the candidate's 
    student  lists with grades since the candidate's last greensheet
review, and (ii) the candidate's current advisee list, and (iii)
the lists from the candidate (2 above).

</a>
    <li><a name="Student Selection">            The
candidate&nbsp;will&nbsp;be allowed&nbsp;to cross out students from each list with reasons.

</p><li><a name="Student Selection">  
      The Chair will select students from each of the lists 
  in (2) and (3.c), and&nbsp; will provide a memo 
  in the candidate's greensheets&nbsp;detailing the selection process. These 
  students&nbsp;will be contacted by both e-mail and registered mail.<BR>               
           
           
         

</a>

<a name="Student Selection">In the event that the same student is selected to evaluate both
teaching and advising, s/he may write a single letter that addresses
both teaching and advising.

</a></li></ol>

<p>

In extraordinary cases, exceptions to these guidelines 
may be worked out by the Chair with the candidate, and the Chair&nbsp;will 
document the reason for all adjustments.<a name="Peer Teaching Evaluations">
