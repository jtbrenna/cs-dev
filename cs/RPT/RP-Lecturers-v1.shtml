<a name="Introduction">
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

In accordance with the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~provost/acadunionagrmt.pdf">Agreement
Between the University of Vermont and United Academics (AAUP/AFT)</a>
(referred to as the Union Contract hereafter), this document is
developed to provide reappointment and promotion guidelines for
Lecturers and Senior Lecturers in the Department of Computer Science.

The Department applies the quality criteria for teaching, advising and
service in the Evaluation of Faculty and Reappointment, Promotion and
Tenure Criteria and Procedures in the Union Contract (Article 15), and
has the following additional specific descriptions.

<a name="Student Selection">
<h3>2. Student Selection for Teaching and Advising Evaluations</h3>

<ol>

<li> Numbers of students and advisees to be contacted (N).

<p>

The Chair will solicit teaching evaluations from N students and
advising evaluations also from N advisees, where N is as follows for
the following types of RPT reviews:

<pre>
  N: Type of review
---  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  4: Lecturer/Senior Lecturer re-appointments with green sheet reviews
  6: Senior Lecturer promotions
</pre>

<li> The candidate will be asked to provide a list of N nominations
for students and another list of N nominations for advisees.

<p>

<li> An ad-hoc committee will be formed each academic year by the
Chair to provide N student nominations and N advisee nominations:

<p>
<ol TYPE=a>

<li> The ad-hoc committee will consist of at least two members;

<li> The Department Office will provide (i) the candidate's student
lists with grades since the candidate's last greensheet review, and
(ii) the candidate's current advisee list;

<li> The ad-hoc committee will compile an initial list of at least
1.5*N students and another initial list of at least 1.5*N advisees
from (b); and

<li> The candidate will be given a chance to look at these initial
lists and cross out up to 0.5*N students from each list with reasons.

</ol>
<p>
To maintain consistency, the ad hoc committee will be formed each
academic year for all RPT candidates.
<p>

<li> The Chair will select N students and N advisees from (2) and
(3.d).  These students and advisees will be contacted by both e-mail
and registered mail, and the Chair will provide a memo in the
candidate's greensheets on how the students and advisees are selected.

</ol>

<p>

In the event that the same student is selected to evaluate both
teaching and advising, he/she may write a single letter that addresses
both teaching and advising.

<a name="Peer Teaching Evaluations"> 
<h3>3. Peer Teaching Evaluations</h3> 
 
For each greensheet review, 2 to 3 faculty members will be invited by 
the Chair to provide peer teaching evaluations. The candidate is 
allowed to name up to 2 faculty members in the Department who should 
not be invited for this purpose. 
 
<p> 
 
The peer teaching evaluations should come from qualified faculty, and 
some of them should come from eligible voters as defined in Section 
5.2 if at all possible.  For a candidate who teaches a service 
course, the Chair is encouraged to invite an appropriate faculty 
member from another department to provide a peer teaching evaluation. 
 
<p> 
 
The peer evaluators are advised to look over the candidate's course 
materials as well as attend at least one of the candidate's lectures. 
 
<p> 

<a name="Advising">
<h3>4. Advising</h3>

Lecturers and Senior Lecturers under greensheet reviews are advised to
have a separate section on advising in their greensheets.
In addition to student numbers, useful information would include:

<ol>

<li> How often the candidate meets with his/her students.

<li> How actively the candidate contacts them when they need the
advisor's help.

<li> Which type of feedback the candidate gets from them (relevant
correspondence would be useful to mention).

<li> Whether the candidate has helped the Department in providing
advising help.

</ol>

<a name="Faculty Input and Eligible Voters">
<h3>5. Faculty Input and Eligible Voters for RPT Reviews</h3>

<a name="Faculty Input">
<h4>5.1. Faculty Input and Schedule for RPT Reviews</h4>

The Chair should set an appropriate schedule for each greensheet
review, so that the complete greensheets will be ready for faculty
review <i>at least 2 weeks before the submission deadline to the
Dean's Office</i>.

<p>

Once the greensheets are ready for faculty review, all faculty 
members, tenured and untenured (including tenure-track/tenured 
faculty, research faculty, Lecturers, and Senior Lecturers) will be 
invited to review the greensheets and share their advice concerning 
the candidate with the Chair within a week. The feedback will be 
documented in the Chair's Evaluation. 

<p>

At the beginning of the second week after the greensheets are
complete, the Chair will convene (i) a meeting of all faculty members
to discuss the greensheets, and (ii) a closed session for all eligible
voters (as defined in Section 5.2) to vote on whether or not to
recommend the candidate's application.  This vote will be recorded in
the Chair's Evaluation.

<p>

After the above faculty feedback and eligible voters' vote, the Chair
will decide whether or not to recommend the candidate's application,
and will inform the candidate with a detailed Chair's Evaluation.

<a name="Eligible Voters">
<h4>5.2. Eligible Voters for Lecturer/Senior Lecturer Greensheet
Reviews</h4>

<ul>

<li> For a Lecturer reappointment with a greensheet review, Senior
Lecturers, tenure-track/tenured faculty members, and those Lecturers
who have successfully passed a reappointment review in the past and
are not applying for a reappointment in the current year, are eligible
voters.

<li> For a Senior Lecturer application, only Senior Lecturers and
tenured faculty members are eligible voters.

<li> For a Senior Lecturer reappointment with a greensheet review,
only tenured faculty members are eligible voters.

</ul>

The Chair is not an eligible voter.  

<a name="Senior Lecturer">
<h3>6. Guidelines for Promotion to Senior Lecturer</h3>

<i>The following guidelines for promotion to Senior Lecturer were
formally approved by Dean Robert Jenkins on May 29, 2003.</i>
<p>

An application for Senior Lecturer in Computer Science will be
evaluated on the following criteria.

<ul>

<li>  A minimum of 6 years (within an eight year period) of service, as
    specified in the Union Contract
<li>  Subject to a regular RPT review without the research
    expectations
<li>  A good citizenship in terms of service activities within the
    Department
<li>  Evidence of sustained quality teaching

</ul>

<a name="Rebuttal and Appeal">
<h3>7. Rebuttal and Appeal</h3>

After receiving the Chair's Evaluation on a reappointment or promotion
review, the faculty member may rebut or appeal, following the
procedures described in the Union Contract.
