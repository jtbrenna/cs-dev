<a name="Introduction">
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

In accordance with the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~provost/acadunionagrmt.pdf">Agreement
Between the University of Vermont and United Academics (AAUP/AFT)</a>
(referred to as the Union Contract hereafter), this document is
developed to provide RPT (reappointment, promotion and tenure) and
annual review guidelines in the Department of Computer Science.  <a
href="#process">Appendix A</a> provides a summary on how this document
was prepared.

<a name="Department Considerations">
<h3>2. Department Considerations</h3>

The Department of Computer Science is a research-oriented
department. The Department upholds and strengthens the mission of the
University of Vermont towards the provision of innovation in research
and scholarship, excellence in instruction, and public service to the
citizens of the state, nation and world.  The Department aspires to be
a center of excellence in teaching computer science at all levels,
emphasizing both long-term academic preparation and shorter-term
economic importance; and as a center for excellence in research and
graduate education by developing strengths in a small number of
focused research areas and by exploiting Computer Science's unique
opportunities for collaborations with other strong research areas in
the University.

<p>

The Department is moving forward at a fast pace with our PhD program,
and aims to become a first-rate Computer Science department in the
near future.  Each faculty member (except non-tenure-track research
faculty) is expected to be an effective teacher, and all research
faculty and tenure-track faculty members are expected to be active
researchers in their respective areas.  The quality criteria for
effective teaching and active research can be found from the Criteria
in Appointment, Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure Decisions (see <a
href="#UVM-Criteria">Appendix C below</a>) in the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~provost/Officers_Handbookrevised_03.pdf">University
of Vermont Officers' Handbook</a>.

<a name="RPT Evaluations">
<h3>3. RPT Evaluations in Computer Science</h3>

For reappointment, promotion and tenure (RPT) evaluations, the
Department applies the Criteria in Appointment, Reappointment,
Promotion, and Tenure Decisions in the University
of Vermont Officers' Handbook and the criteria in the Officers of
Instruction section in the Union Contract, and has the following
additional specific descriptions.

<!--
<h4>Teaching</h4>

Anything specific to mention?
-->

<a name="Student Selection">
<h4>3.1 Student Selection for Teaching and Advising Evaluations</h4>

<ol>

<li> Numbers of students and advisees to be contacted (N).

<p>

The Chair will solicit teaching evaluations from N students and
advising evaluations also from N advisees, where N is as follows for
the following types of RPT reviews:

<pre>
  N: Type of review
---  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  4: Lecturer/Senior Lecturer re-appointments with green sheet reviews
  4: First tenure-track re-appointments
  6: Senior Lecturer promotions and second tenure-track re-appointments
  8: Tenure and Associate/Full Professor promotions
</pre>

<li> The candidate will be asked to provide a list of N nominations
for students and another list of N nominations for advisees.

<p>

<li> An ad-hoc committee will be formed each academic year by the
Chair to provide N student nominations and N advisee nominations:

<p>
<ol TYPE=a>

<li> The ad-hoc committee will consist of at least two members;

<li> The Department Office will provide (i) the candidate's student
lists with grades since the candidate's last greensheet review, and
(ii) the candidate's current advisee list;

<li> The ad-hoc committee will compile an initial list of at least
1.5*N students and another initial list of at least 1.5*N advisees
from (b); and

<li> The candidate will be given a chance to look at these initial
lists and cross out up to 0.5*N students from each list with reasons.

</ol>
<p>
To maintain consistency, the ad hoc committee will be formed each
academic year for all RPT candidates.
<p>

<li> The Chair will select N students and N advisees from (2) and
(3.d).  These students and advisees will be contacted by both e-mail
and registered mail, and the Chair will provide a memo in the
candidate's greensheets on how the students and advisees are selected.

</ol>

<p>

In the event that the same student is selected to evaluate both
teaching and advising, he/she may write a single letter that addresses
both teaching and advising.

<a name="Peer Teaching Evaluations">
<h4>3.2 Peer Teaching Evaluations</h4>

For each greensheet review, 2 to 3 faculty members will be invited by
the Chair to provide peer teaching evaluations. The candidate is
allowed to name up to 2 faculty members in the Department who should
not be invited for this purpose.

<p>

The peer teaching evaluations should come from qualified faculty, and
some of them should come from eligible voters as defined in Section
3.6.2 if at all possible.  For a candidate who teaches a service
course, the Chair is encouraged to invite an appropriate faculty
member from another department to provide a peer teaching evaluation.

<p>

The peer evaluators are advised to look over the candidate's course
materials as well as attend at least one of the candidate's lectures.

<p>

<a name="Advising">
<h4>3.3 Advising</h4>

All teaching faculty under greensheet reviews are advised to have a
separate section on advising in their greensheets, to provide
information on their undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc supervision.
In addition to student numbers, useful information would include:

<ol>

<li> How often the candidate meets with his/her students.

<li> How actively the candidate contacts them when they need the
advisor's help.

<li> Which type of feedback the candidate gets from them (relevant
correspondence would be useful to mention).

<li> Whether the candidate has helped the Department in providing
advising help.

<!--
<li> Possible joint publications with the students and postdocs.
-->

</ol>

<a name="Research">
<h4>3.4 Research</h4>

All research, tenure-track, and tenured faculty members must provide
"evidence that the candidate is continuously and effectively engaged
in scholarly activity of high quality and significance" as required by
the University RPT criteria (see Appendix C).  All tenured and
tenure-track faculty members of the Department are expected to
establish themselves as computer scientists, and their research is
expected to have strong relevance to Computer Science.

<p>

Publication of refereed articles in both journals and conferences is
very important; in some areas of computer science, publication in
top-tier conferences is considered as prestigious as publication in
top journals.  Acquisition of competitive grant and contract support
is considered an indication of recognized research competence and
productivity.  Similarly, invited lectures or publications, journal
editorship, or service as a major officer in a professional society,
may be considered as recognition of scholarly achievement.  Patents,
software products, monographs, book chapters, unpublished conference
presentations, and other products of scholarly activity may also be
considered.

<p>

For peer-reviewed journal publications, the candidate is advised to
provide information regarding the standards of the journal and its
standing in the discipline. For conference proceedings, the candidate
is asked to distinguish the level of peer-review (fully-refereed,
abstract-refereed, non-refereed) and to provide information about the
conference acceptance rates, if possible.  For monographs and book
chapters, the candidate is advised to provide information regarding
the review process of the press, and whether or not the work was
invited.  Candidates are encouraged to outline the significant
contributions of each major publication.

<p>

<a name="Co-Authors">

Collaborative, interdisciplinary, and cross-disciplinary research is
strongly encouraged.  For joint publications, the candidate should
describe their role in the joint effort.  For all greensheet reviews
but the first tenure-track reappointment, the candidate will be asked
to provide contact information for co-authors with whom the candidate
has created or published joint work since the last greensheet review.
These co-authors will then be invited by the Chair to comment on their
perception of the role of the candidate in their joint work.  For
interdisciplinary or cross-disciplinary work, the candidate is advised
to describe the nature of the publication venue and the relationship
of the research to Computer Science.

<a name="Arm's-Length Evaluators">
<h4>3.5 Selection of Arm's-Length Evaluators</h4>

For the following greensheet reviews, "arm's-length" evaluators will
be solicited to provide external reports:

<ul>

<li> second re-appointment for years 6 and 7 of tenure-track
faculty,

<li> tenure and promotion to Associate Professor,

<li> promotion to the rank of Professor, and

<li> promotion to Research Associate Professor and Research Professor.

</ul>

Arm's-length evaluators are individuals who do not have a significant
personal relationship with the candidate.  They are not former
students, thesis advisors, former or present colleagues, co-authors,
or collaborators.

<p>

Also, arm's-length evaluators should

<ol> 

<li> Be "acknowledged scholars and practitioners in the discipline of
the candidate at other institutions. These scholars and practitioners
should ... be capable of providing an objective, informed assessment
of the candidate's work." [The Union Contract, Article 15, Clause 4,
Page 30.]
 
<li> Be tenured at their home universities (and for promotion to the
rank of Professor or Research Professor, have the same or an
equivalent rank), if they come from academia.

<li> Have expertise in at least one of the candidate's research areas.

</ol>

The Chair will inform the arm's-length reviewers of all pertinent
facts regarding the candidate, with the candidate's representative
publications and other creative work, and will ask them for comments
on

<ul> 
 
<li> the quality of the candidate's research, 
<li> the candidate's research contributions to his/her research field,
<li> the candidate's productivity relative to other 
academics at a similar stage in  their career, 
<li> the candidate's potential as a research leader, and

<li> the publication and review standards of the journals and
conference proceedings in which the candidate has published, and their
standings in the discipline.

</ul> 

<a name="Arm's-Length - Numbers">
<h5>3.5.1 Numbers of Arm's-Length Evaluators</h5>

<ul> 
 
<li> For a second re-appointment for years 6 and 7 of tenure-track
faculty, the Chair will solicit 4 arm's-length evaluations.
 
<li> For promotion to Research Associate Professor, the Chair will
solicit 6 arm's-length evaluations.

<li> For tenure and promotion to Associate Professor, the Chair will
solicit 10 arm's-length evaluations. 

<li> For promotion to the rank of Professor or Research Professor, the
Chair will solicit 6 arm's-length evaluations.
 
</ul> 

<a name="Arm's-Length - Selection">
<h5>3.5.2 The Selection Process</h5>

N below refers to the number of arm's-length evaluators that the Chair
will contact for each type of greensheet reviews, as defined in
Section 3.5.1.

<ol>  
  
<li> The candidate is asked to provide N nominations.

<li> The Chair compiles N other names from other sources.

<li> The Chair shows the N other names to the candidate and asks the
candidate to identify (1) any names that are not at arm'- length, and
(2) any names with whom the candidate has personal/professional
disagreements.

<li> The Chair selects and contacts N names from the combined list,
with at least half from the candidate's list.

<li> In the greensheets for all faculty to review, the Chair will list
these N names and mention who were nominated by the candidate and who
were solicited by the Chair independently.

</ol>  

<a name="Faculty Input and Eligible Voters">
<h4>3.6 Faculty Input and Eligible Voters for RPT Reviews</h4>

<a name="Faculty Input">
<h5>3.6.1 Faculty Input and Schedule for RPT Reviews</h5>

The Chair should set an appropriate schedule for each greensheet
review, so that the complete greensheets will be ready for faculty
review <i>at least 2 weeks before the submission deadline to the
Dean's Office</i>.

<p>

Once the greensheets are ready for faculty review, all faculty
members, tenured and untenured (including tenure-track faculty,
Lecturers, and Senior Lecturers) will be invited to review the
greensheets and share their advice concerning the candidate with the
Chair within a week. The feedback will be documented in the Chair's
Evaluation.

<p>

At the beginning of the second week after the greensheets are
complete, the Chair will convene (i) a meeting of all faculty members
to discuss the greensheets, and (ii) a closed session for all eligible
voters (as defined in Section 3.6.2) to vote on whether or not to
recommend the candidate's application.  This vote will be recorded in
the Chair's Evaluation.

<p>

After the above faculty feedback and eligible voters' vote, the Chair
will decide whether or not to recommend the candidate's application,
and will inform the candidate with a detailed Chair's Evaluation.

<a name="Eligible Voters">
<h5>3.6.2 Eligible Voters for RPT Reviews</h4>

When a candidate applies for promotion to a particular rank, only
those faculty members who are already at this rank or above are
eligible voters. When a candidate applies for reappointment at a
particular rank, only those faculty members who have successfully
passed their reappointment at this rank and will not be evaluated
again for the same level of reappointment, are eligible voters.

<ul>

<li> For a Lecturer reappointment with a greensheet review, Senior
Lecturers, tenure-track/tenured faculty members, and those Lecturers
who have successfully passed a reappointment review in the past and
are not applying for a reappointment in the current year, are eligible
voters.

<li> For a Senior Lecturer application, only Senior Lecturers and
tenured faculty members are eligible voters.

<li> For a Senior Lecturer reappointment with a greensheet review,
only tenured faculty members are eligible voters.

<li> For a research associate/research assistant professor
reappointment with a greensheet review, tenure-track/tenured faculty
members, Research Associate Professors, Research Professors, and those
research associates/research assistant professors who have
successfully passed a greensheet review in the past and are not
applying for a reappointment in the current year, are eligible voters.

<li> For a first tenure-track reappointment review, only tenured
faculty members and those faculty who have successfully passed their
first reappointment review are eligible voters.

<li> For a second reappointment review, only tenured faculty members
and those faculty who have successfully passed their second
reappointment review are eligible voters.

<li> For a tenure application, only tenured faculty members are
eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Associate Professor, only Associate
Professors and Professors are eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Professor, only Professors are
eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Research Associate Professor, only
Research Associate Professors, Research Professors, Associate
Professors and Professors are eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Research Professor, only
Professors and Research Professors are eligible voters.

</ul>

The Chair is not an eligible voter.  
<!--
If the number of eligible voters is less than 3 for a particular type
of greensheet review, the Chair will consult with the candidate(s) and
invite our secondary appointments at appropriate ranks to make up at
least 3 eligible voters for each greensheet review.
-->

<a name="Senior Lecturer">
<h4>3.7 Guidelines for Promotion to Senior Lecturer</h4>

<i>The following guidelines for promotion to Senior Lecturer were
formally approved by Dean Robert Jenkins on May 29, 2003.</i>
<p>

An application for Senior Lecturer in Computer Science will be
evaluated on the following criteria.

<ul>

<li>  A minimum of 6 years (within an eight year period) of service, as
    specified in the Union Contract
<li>  Subject to a regular RPT review without the research
    expectations
<li>  A good citizenship in terms of service activities within the
    Department
<li>  Evidence of sustained quality teaching

</ul>

<a name="Associate Professor">
<h4>3.8 Tenure and Promotion to Associate Professor</h4>

<a name="P&T Reviews">
<h5>3.8.1 Mandatory vs. Requested P&T Reviews</h5>

<ul>

<li> After 5 years' of service in a tenure-track position, a candidate
for tenure and promotion will be notified by the Chair in the
appropriate June that the review process must begin in the following
academic year, and that the candidate is asked to nominate 6
arm's-length evaluators with a given deadline.

<li> A faculty member may become a candidate at an earlier date.  In
such an early-tenure case, the faculty member should let the Chair
know by the appropriate May. The Chair may provide some informal
advice after possible consultation with tenured members in the
Department, but the decision for early-tenure application is with the
candidate.

<li> The evaluation procedure is the same for both mandatory and
requested reviews. A candidate for tenure and promotion in either case
is expected to be an established researcher in his/her research field,
in addition to the university criteria (see Appendix C).

</ul>

<a name="Withdrawal">
<h5>3.8.2 Withdrawal of Early-Tenure Applications</h5>

After the Chair's Evaluation in Section 3.6.1, an early-tenure
candidate may choose to withdraw the current tenure and promotion
application.

<a name="Professor">
<h4>3.9 Promotion to the Rank of Professor</h4>

An Associate Professor who wishes to be considered for promotion to
the rank of Professor should notify the Chair by the appropriate May
so that arm's-length evaluators can be organized in the following
summer.

<p>

Promotion to the rank of Professor requires a sustained record of
excellence in teaching, research, and service, and the candidate
should enjoy a recognized national or international reputation in
his/her research field.

<p>

After the Chair's Evaluation in Section 3.6.1, a candidate for
promotion to Professor may choose to withdraw the current application.

<a name="Research Promotion">
<h4>3.10 Promotion to Research Associate Professor and Research
Professor</h4>

A research faculty member may become a candidate for promotion by
personal request or by recommendation of the Chair (who is the formal
supervisor of each research faculty member in the Department).  Such a
request or recommendation should be discussed in the appropriate May
so that arm's-length evaluators can be organized in the following
summer.

<p>

Research faculty members do not have teaching or service expectations
in the Department, but if the candidate has performed significant
teaching or service work, he/she may choose to include this work in
the promotion greensheets.  

<p>

The candidate's research will be evaluated in a manner similar to that
used by the Department in evaluating promotions to Associate
Professor and Professor.

<p>

After the Chair's Evaluation in Section 3.6.1, a candidate for
promotion may choose to withdraw the current application.

<a name="Annual Review">
<h3>4. Annual Faculty Evaluations</h3>

In accordance with the Union Contract, the annual faculty review will
focus on the faculty member's performance during the academic year in
which the review takes place but will also take into account the
faculty member's performance during the preceding two years.

<p>

In late January each year, each faculty member is requested to
complete the Annual Faculty Activity Report form (see <a
href="#annual-form">Appendix B below</a>) by February 15. The faculty
may choose to include any additional relevant information.

<p>

In April each year, the Chair will meet with the faculty member to
discuss the faculty member's performance and the following academic
year's workload plan. Before or at this meeting, the faculty member
can add any written information to the faculty member's Annual Faculty
Activity Report. The Chair will provide a written evaluation for the
faculty member at or after the meeting.

<a name="Percentages of Effort">
<h4>4.1 Percentages of Faculty Effort</h4>

The percentages of effort devoted to each of the categories of
teaching, research and scholarship, and service, are initially set in
the annual April meeting between the Chair and the faculty member for
returning faculty, and during the hiring process for new faculty.
They are included in the faculty member's workload plan, and can be
modified as appropriate or necessary during the following academic
year.

<p>

The norms for these percentages are given below.

<pre>
Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant Professor

                Teaching:        40% 
                Research:        40% 
                Service:         20%        

Senior Lecturer, Lecturer

                Teaching:        80%                 
                Service:         20%        

Research Professor, Research Associate Professor and Research
Assistant Professor

                Research:       100% 
</pre>

The faculty member may wish to focus his/her energy on one particular
activity in a particular year.  In this case, the faculty member and
the Chair should agree upon revised percentages at the annual April
meeting and put them in the workload plan.

<a name="Chair's Evaluation">
<h4>4.2 Chair's Evaluation on Annual Faculty Performance</h4>

Based on 

<ol>

<li> the workload plan for the current year, 
<li> the Annual Faculty Activity Report, 
<li> possible additional information from the faculty
member before/at the annual April meeting, and
<li> course evaluations and student feedback in the past
calendar year,

</ol>

the Chair will evaluate the faculty member's performance in each of
the categories of teaching, research and scholarship, and service, if
its percentage in the workload plan is not zero.  The evaluation will
apply quality indicators in the University criteria (in Appendix C)
and in the additional Computer Science specific descriptions in
Section 3 to review the faculty member's annual performance.

<p>

The Chair's evaluation of teaching excellence needs to be reflective
of a more comprehensive look beyond just the numerical overall score
on the student evaluation forms.

<p>

The Chair will also provide one of the following 3 overall ratings on
the faculty member's annual performance:

<ul>

<li> <b>Outstanding.</b> An outstanding performance must achieve at
least two <i>excellent</i> ratings in teaching, research and
scholarship, and service, and should not have any serious shortcomings
in the third category (if its percentage in the workload plan is not
zero).  For a research faculty member who dedicates 100% of the effort
to research, an <i>outstanding</i> rating in research is an
outstanding performance.

<li> <b>Unsatisfactory.</b> An unsatisfactory performance would have
at least one <i>not acceptable</i> rating and no <i>excellent</i>
ratings in teaching, research and scholarship, and service.

<li> <b>Satisfactory.</b> A satisfactory performance is neither
outstanding nor unsatisfactory.

</ul>

<a name="Rebuttal and Appeal">
<h3>5. Rebuttal and Appeal</h3>

After receiving the Chair's Evaluation on either a RPT review or an
annual performance review, the faculty member may rebut or appeal,
following the procedures described in the Union Contract or the
Officer's Handbook.

<a name="process"> 
<h3>Appendix A: Generation Process of These Guidelines</h3>

Xindong Wu (the Chair) wrote the first draft of this document, and
sent it to all Computer Science faculty for feedback on February 24,
2004.  The tenured faculty of the Department had a meeting on February
27, 2004, to discuss this draft and some of the individual feedback.
A revised version after this meeting and individual faculty feedback
was discussed at a faculty meeting on March 4, 2004. A further revised
version after the faculty meeting and some follow-up e-mail
discussions was forwarded to all Computer Science faculty for possible
further feedback on March 4, 2004, before this final version is sent
to the Dean for approval on March 8, 2004.
