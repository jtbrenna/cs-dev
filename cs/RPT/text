Hi All,

The newest version of this document is now available on the Web at
http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~xwu/Dept/RPT/RP-Lecturers.shtml

In addition to the changes agreed at today's faculty meeting, I have
also taken out the following statement

 At least one evaluation should be done by an eligible voter, as
 defined in Section 5.2.

from the 2nd paragraph in Section 3.2, to make it consistent with the
RPT Guidelines for Tenure-Track and Tenured Faculty
(http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~xwu/Dept/RPT/RPT-TTT.shtml).  I talked with
Jeanne before making this change, and Jeanne supported it. If anyone
is unhappy with this change, please air your voice *by Thursday 4/29 at 
12 noon*.

Please also double check the revised document and let me know any
typos etc *by Thursday 4/29 at 12 noon*.

One of the two faculty members who abstained at today's faculty
meeting asked me to change the abstention to a positive vote, and we
have clearly built a consensus on this document.  Thanks to everyone
again for your active participation in the development of this
important document.

Xindong
