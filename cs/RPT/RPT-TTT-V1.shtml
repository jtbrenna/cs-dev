<a name="Introduction">
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

In accordance with the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~provost/acadunionagrmt.pdf">Agreement
Between the University of Vermont and United Academics (AAUP/AFT)</a>
(referred to as the Union Contract hereafter), this document is
developed to provide RPT (reappointment, promotion and tenure) and
guidelines for tenure-track and tenured faculty in the Department of
Computer Science.

<a name="Department Considerations">
<h3>2. Department Considerations</h3>

The Department of Computer Science is a research-oriented
department. The Department upholds and strengthens the mission of the
University of Vermont towards the provision of innovation in research
and scholarship, excellence in instruction, and public service to the
citizens of the state, nation and world.  The Department aspires to be
a center of excellence in teaching computer science at all levels,
emphasizing both long-term academic preparation and shorter-term
economic importance; and as a center for excellence in research and
graduate education by developing strengths in a small number of
focused research areas and by exploiting Computer Science's unique
opportunities for collaborations with other strong research areas in
the University.

<p>

The Department is moving forward at a fast pace with our PhD program,
and aims to become a first-rate Computer Science department in the
near future.  Each faculty member (except non-tenure-track research
faculty) is expected to be an effective teacher, and all research
faculty and tenure-track faculty members are expected to be active
researchers in their respective areas.  The quality criteria for
effective teaching and active research can be found from the Union
Contract (Article 15).

<a name="RPT Evaluations">
<h3>3. RPT Evaluations in Computer Science</h3>

For reappointment, promotion and tenure (RPT) evaluations, the
Department applies the Evaluation of Faculty and Reappointment,
Promotion and Tenure Criteria and Procedures in the Union Contract
(Article 15), and has the following additional specific descriptions.

<a name="Student Selection">
<h4>3.1 Student Selection for Teaching and Advising Evaluations</h4>

<ol>

<li> Numbers of students and advisees to be contacted (N).

<p>

The Chair will solicit teaching evaluations from N students and
advising evaluations also from N advisees, where N is as follows for
the following types of RPT reviews:

<pre>
  N: Type of review
---  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  4: First tenure-track re-appointments
  6: Second tenure-track re-appointments
  8: Tenure and Associate/Full Professor promotions
</pre>

<i> If the candidate has only M advisees (including present and former
advisees), and M <= N+1, the number of advisees for the candidate will
be adjusted to M-2.</i>

<p>

<li> The candidate will be asked to provide a list of N nominations
for students and another list of N nominations for advisees.

<p>

<li> An ad-hoc committee will be formed each academic year by the
Chair to provide N student nominations and N advisee nominations:

<p>
<ol TYPE=a>

<li> The ad-hoc committee will consist of at least two members;

<li> The Department Office will provide (i) the candidate's student
lists with grades since the candidate's last greensheet review, and
(ii) the candidate's current advisee list;

<li> The ad-hoc committee will compile an initial list of at least
1.5*N students and another initial list of at least 1.5*N advisees
from (b); and

<li> The candidate will be given a chance to look at these initial
lists and cross out up to 0.5*N students from each list with reasons.

</ol>
<p>
To maintain consistency, the ad hoc committee will be formed each
academic year for all RPT candidates.
<p>

<li> The Chair will select N students and N advisees from (2) and
(3.d).  These students and advisees will be contacted by both e-mail
and registered mail, and the Chair will provide a memo in the
candidate's greensheets on how the students and advisees are selected.

</ol>

<p>

In the event that the same student is selected to evaluate both
teaching and advising, he/she may write a single letter that addresses
both teaching and advising.

<a name="Peer Teaching Evaluations">
<h4>3.2 Peer Teaching Evaluations</h4>

For each greensheet review, 2 to 3 faculty members will be invited by
the Chair to provide peer teaching evaluations. The candidate is
allowed to name up to 2 faculty members in the Department who should
not be invited for this purpose.

<p>

The peer teaching evaluations should come from qualified faculty, and
some of them should come from eligible voters as defined in Section
3.6.2 if at all possible.  For a candidate who teaches a service
course, the Chair is encouraged to invite an appropriate faculty
member from another department to provide a peer teaching evaluation.

<p>

The peer evaluators are advised to look over the candidate's course
materials as well as attend at least one of the candidate's lectures.

<p>

<a name="Advising">
<h4>3.3 Advising</h4>

All teaching faculty under greensheet reviews are advised to have a
separate section on advising in their greensheets, to provide
information on their undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc supervision.
In addition to student numbers, useful information would include:

<ol>

<li> How often the candidate meets with his/her students.

<li> How actively the candidate contacts them when they need the
advisor's help.

<li> Which type of feedback the candidate gets from them (relevant
correspondence would be useful to mention).

<li> Whether the candidate has helped the Department in providing
advising help.

<!--
<li> Possible joint publications with the students and postdocs.
-->

</ol>

<a name="Research">
<h4>3.4 Research</h4>

According to the Union Contract, "each faculty member is expected to
engage continuously and effectively in creative professional
activities of high quality and significance."  All research,
tenure-track, and tenured faculty members must provide evidence in
this regard for their RPT reviews.  All tenured and tenure-track
faculty members of the Department are expected to establish themselves
as computer scientists, and their research is expected to have strong
relevance to Computer Science.

<p>

Publication of refereed articles in both journals and conferences is
very important; in some areas of computer science, publication in
top-tier conferences is considered as prestigious as publication in
top journals.  Acquisition of competitive grant and contract support
is considered an indication of recognized research competence and
productivity.  Similarly, invited lectures or publications, journal
editorship, or service as a major officer in a professional society,
may be considered as recognition of scholarly achievement.  Patents,
software products, monographs, book chapters, unpublished conference
presentations, and other products of scholarly activity may also be
considered.

<p>

For peer-reviewed journal publications, the candidate is advised to
provide information regarding the standards of the journal and its
standing in the discipline. For conference proceedings, the candidate
is asked to distinguish the level of peer-review (fully-refereed,
abstract-refereed, non-refereed) and to provide information about the
conference acceptance rates, if possible.  For monographs and book
chapters, the candidate is advised to provide information regarding
the review process of the press, and whether or not the work was
invited.  Candidates are encouraged to outline the significant
contributions of each major publication.

<p>

<a name="Co-Authors">

Collaborative, interdisciplinary, and cross-disciplinary research is
strongly encouraged.  For joint publications, the candidate should
describe their role in the joint effort.  For all greensheet reviews
but the first tenure-track reappointment, the candidate will be asked
to provide contact information for co-authors with whom the candidate
has created or published joint work since the last greensheet review.
These co-authors will then be invited by the Chair to comment on their
perception of the role of the candidate in their joint work.  For
interdisciplinary or cross-disciplinary work, the candidate is advised
to describe the nature of the publication venue and the relationship
of the research to Computer Science.

<a name="Arm's-Length Evaluators">
<h4>3.5 Selection of Arm's-Length Evaluators</h4>

For the following tenure-track/tenured faculty greensheet reviews,
"arm's-length" evaluators will be solicited to provide external
reports:

<ul>

<li> second re-appointment for years 6 and 7 of tenure-track
faculty,

<li> tenure and promotion to Associate Professor, and

<li> promotion to the rank of Professor.

</ul>

Arm's-length evaluators are individuals who do not have a significant
personal relationship with the candidate.  They are not former
students, thesis advisors, former or present colleagues, co-authors,
or collaborators.

<p>

Also, arm's-length evaluators should

<ol> 

<li> Be "acknowledged scholars and practitioners in the discipline of
the candidate at other institutions. These scholars and practitioners
should ... be capable of providing an objective, informed assessment
of the candidate's work." [The Union Contract, Article 15, Clause 4,
Page 30.]
 
<li> Be tenured at their home universities (and for promotion to the
rank of Professor or Research Professor, have the same or an
equivalent rank), if they come from academia.

<li> Have expertise in at least one of the candidate's research areas.

</ol>

The Chair will inform the arm's-length reviewers of all pertinent
facts regarding the candidate, with the candidate's representative
publications and other creative work, and will ask them for comments
on

<ul> 
 
<li> the quality of the candidate's research, 
<li> the candidate's research contributions to his/her research field,
<li> the candidate's productivity relative to other 
academics at a similar stage in  their career, 
<li> the candidate's potential as a research leader, and

<li> the publication and review standards of the journals and
conference proceedings in which the candidate has published, and their
standings in the discipline.

</ul> 

<a name="Arm's-Length - Numbers">
<h5>3.5.1 Numbers of Arm's-Length Evaluators</h5>

<ul> 
 
<li> For a second re-appointment for years 6 and 7 of tenure-track
faculty, the Chair will solicit 4 arm's-length evaluations.
 
<li> For tenure and promotion to Associate Professor, the Chair will
solicit 10 arm's-length evaluations. 

<li> For promotion to the rank of Professor, the
Chair will solicit 6 arm's-length evaluations.
 
</ul> 

<a name="Arm's-Length - Selection">
<h5>3.5.2 The Selection Process</h5>

N below refers to the number of arm's-length evaluators that the Chair
will contact for each type of greensheet reviews, as defined in
Section 3.5.1.

<ol>  
  
<li> The candidate is asked to provide N nominations.

<li> The Chair compiles N other names from other sources.

<li> The Chair shows the N other names to the candidate and asks the
candidate to identify (1) any names that are not at arm'- length, and
(2) any names with whom the candidate has personal/professional
disagreements.

<li> The Chair selects and contacts N names from the combined list,
with at least half from the candidate's list.

<li> In the greensheets for all faculty to review, the Chair will list
these N names and mention who were nominated by the candidate and who
were solicited by the Chair independently.

</ol>  

<a name="Faculty Input and Eligible Voters">
<h4>3.6 Faculty Input and Eligible Voters for RPT Reviews</h4>

<a name="Faculty Input">
<h5>3.6.1 Faculty Input and Schedule for RPT Reviews</h5>

The Chair should set an appropriate schedule for each greensheet
review, so that the complete greensheets will be ready for faculty
review <i>at least 2 weeks before the submission deadline to the
Dean's Office</i>.

<p>

Once the greensheets are ready for faculty review, all faculty
members, tenured and untenured (including tenure-track/tenured
faculty, research faculty, Lecturers, and Senior Lecturers) will be
invited to review the greensheets and share their advice concerning
the candidate with the Chair within a week. The feedback will be
documented in the Chair's Evaluation.

<p>

At the beginning of the second week after the greensheets are
complete, the Chair will convene (i) a meeting of all faculty members
to discuss the greensheets, and (ii) a closed session for all eligible
voters (as defined in Section 3.6.2) to vote on whether or not to
recommend the candidate's application.  This vote will be recorded in
the Chair's Evaluation.

<p>

After the above faculty feedback and eligible voters' vote, the Chair
will decide whether or not to recommend the candidate's application,
and will inform the candidate with a detailed Chair's Evaluation.

<a name="Eligible Voters">
<h5>3.6.2 Eligible Voters for RPT Reviews</h4>

When a candidate applies for promotion to a particular rank, only
those faculty members who are already at this rank or above are
eligible voters. When a candidate applies for reappointment at a
particular rank, only those faculty members who have successfully
passed their reappointment at this rank, are eligible voters.

<ul>

<li> For a first tenure-track reappointment review, only tenured
faculty members and those faculty who have successfully passed their
first reappointment review are eligible voters.

<li> For a second reappointment review, only tenured faculty members
and those faculty who have successfully passed their second
reappointment review are eligible voters.

<li> For a tenure application, only tenured faculty members are
eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Associate Professor, only Associate
Professors and Professors are eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Professor, only Professors are
eligible voters.

</ul>

The Chair is not an eligible voter.  

<a name="Associate Professor">
<h4>3.7 Tenure and Promotion to Associate Professor</h4>

<a name="P&T Reviews">
<h5>3.7.1 Mandatory vs. Requested P&T Reviews</h5>

<ul>

<li> After 5 years' of service in a tenure-track position, a candidate
for tenure and promotion will be notified by the Chair in the
appropriate June that the review process must begin in the following
academic year, and that the candidate is asked to nominate 6
arm's-length evaluators with a given deadline.

<li> A faculty member may become a candidate at an earlier date.  In
such an early-tenure case, the faculty member should let the Chair
know by the appropriate May. The Chair may provide some informal
advice after possible consultation with tenured members in the
Department, but the decision for early-tenure application is with the
candidate.

<li> The evaluation procedure is the same for both mandatory and
requested reviews. A candidate for tenure and promotion in either case
is expected to be an established researcher in his/her research field,
in addition to the university criteria given in the Union Contract.

</ul>

<a name="Withdrawal">
<h5>3.7.2 Withdrawal of Early-Tenure Applications</h5>

After the Chair's Evaluation in Section 3.6.1, an early-tenure
candidate may choose to withdraw the current tenure and promotion
application.

<a name="Professor">
<h4>3.8 Promotion to the Rank of Professor</h4>

An Associate Professor who wishes to be considered for promotion to
the rank of Professor should notify the Chair by the appropriate May
so that arm's-length evaluators can be organized in the following
summer.

<p>

Promotion to the rank of Professor requires a sustained record of
excellence in teaching, research, and service, and the candidate
should enjoy a recognized national or international reputation in
his/her research field.

<p>

After the Chair's Evaluation in Section 3.6.1, a candidate for
promotion to Professor may choose to withdraw the current application.

<a name="Rebuttal and Appeal">
<h3>4. Rebuttal and Appeal</h3>

After receiving the Chair's Evaluation on a RPT review, the faculty
member may rebut or appeal, following the procedures described in the
Union Contract.
