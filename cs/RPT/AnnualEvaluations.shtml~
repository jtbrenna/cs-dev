<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

In accordance with the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~provost/acadunionagrmt.pdf">Agreement
Between the University of Vermont and United Academics (AAUP/AFT)</a>
(referred to as the Union Contract hereafter), the annual faculty
review will focus on the faculty member's performance during the
academic year in which the review takes place but will also take into
account the faculty member's performance during the preceding two
years.

<p>

In late January each year, each faculty member is requested to
complete the Annual Faculty Activity Report form (see <a
href="#annual-form">Appendix A below</a>) by February 15. The faculty
may choose to include any additional relevant information.

<p>

In April each year, the Chair will meet with the faculty member to
discuss the faculty member's performance and the following academic
year's workload plan. Before or at this meeting, the faculty member
can add any written information to the faculty member's Annual Faculty
Activity Report. The Chair will provide a written evaluation for the
faculty member at or after the meeting.

<a name="Percentages of Effort">
<h3>2. Percentages of Faculty Effort</h3>

The percentages of effort devoted to each of the categories of
teaching, research and scholarship, and service, are initially set in
the annual April meeting between the Chair and the faculty member for
returning faculty, and during the hiring process for new faculty.
They are included in the faculty member's workload plan, and can be
modified as appropriate or necessary during the following academic
year.

<p>

The norms for these percentages are given below.

<pre>
Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant Professor

                Teaching:        40% 
                Research:        40% 
                Service:         20%        

Senior Lecturer, Lecturer

                Teaching:        80%                 
                Service:         20%        

Research Professor, Research Associate Professor and Research
Assistant Professor

                Research:       100% 
</pre>

The faculty member may wish to focus his/her energy on one particular
activity in a particular year.  In this case, the faculty member and
the Chair should agree upon revised percentages at the annual April
meeting and put them in the workload plan.

<a name="Chair's Evaluation">
<h3>3. Chair's Evaluation on Annual Faculty Performance</h3>

Based on 

<ol>

<li> the workload plan for the current year, 
<li> the Annual Faculty Activity Report, 
<li> possible additional information from the faculty
member before/at the annual April meeting, and
<li> course evaluations and student feedback in the past
calendar year,

</ol>

the Chair will evaluate the faculty member's performance in each of
the categories of teaching, research and scholarship, and service, if
its percentage in the workload plan is not zero.  The evaluation will
apply quality indicators in the university criteria (given in the
Union Contract) and in the additional Computer Science specific
descriptions in Section 3 to review the faculty member's annual
performance.

<p>

The Chair's evaluation of teaching excellence needs to be reflective
of a more comprehensive look beyond just the numerical overall score
on the student evaluation forms.

<p>

The Chair will also provide one of the following 3 overall ratings on
the faculty member's annual performance:

<ul>

<li> <b>Outstanding.</b> An outstanding performance must achieve at
least two <i>excellent</i> ratings in teaching, research and
scholarship, and service, and should not have any serious shortcomings
in the third category (if its percentage in the workload plan is not
zero).  For a research faculty member who dedicates 100% of the effort
to research, an <i>outstanding</i> rating in research is an
outstanding performance.

<li> <b>Unsatisfactory.</b> An unsatisfactory performance would have
at least one <i>not acceptable</i> rating and no <i>excellent</i>
ratings in teaching, research and scholarship, and service.

<li> <b>Satisfactory.</b> A satisfactory performance is neither
outstanding nor unsatisfactory.

</ul>

<a name="Rebuttal and Appeal">
<h3>4. Rebuttal and Appeal</h3>

After receiving the Chair's Evaluation on an annual performance
review, the faculty member may rebut or appeal, following the
procedures described in the Union Contract.
