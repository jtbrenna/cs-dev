<a name="Introduction">
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

In accordance with the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~provost/acadunionagrmt.pdf">Agreement
Between the University of Vermont and United Academics (AAUP/AFT)</a>
(referred to as the Union Contract hereafter), this document is
developed to provide RPT (reappointment, promotion and tenure) and
annual review guidelines in the Department of Computer Science.

<p>
<!--
The Union Contract (Article 13, Clause 3) states that

<blockquote>
<i>In preparing such guidelines all department/school faculty, tenured
and untenured, shall have an opportunity to provide input into what
these criteria and procedures should be. The Dean must approve any
departmental RPT and Annual Review guidelines.</i>
</blockquote>
-->

Xindong Wu (the Chair) wrote the first draft of this document, and
sent it to all Computer Science faculty for feedback on February 24,
2004.  A revised version after individual faculty feedback will be
discussed at a faculty meeting on March 4, 2004, before the final
version is sent to the Dean for approval.

<a name="Department Considerations">
<h3>2. Department Considerations</h3>

The Department of Computer Science is a research-oriented
department. The Department upholds and strengthens the mission of the
University of Vermont towards the provision of innovation in research
and scholarship, excellence in instruction, and public service to the
citizens of the state, nation and world.  The Department aspires to be
a center of excellence in teaching computer science at all levels,
emphasizing both long-term academic preparation and shorter-term
economic importance; and as a center for excellence in research and
graduate education by developing strengths in a small number of
focused research areas and by exploiting Computer Science's unique
opportunities for collaborations with other strong research areas in
the University.

<p>

The Department is moving forward at a fast pace with our PhD program,
and aims to become a first-rate Computer Science department in the
near future.  We expect each faculty member (except non-tenure-track
research faculty) to be an effective teacher, and all research faculty
and tenure-track faculty members to be active researchers in their
respective areas.

<a name="RPT Evaluations">
<h3>3. RPT Evaluations in Computer Science</h3>

For reappointment, promotion and tenure (RPT) evaluations, the
Department applies the Criteria in Appointment, Reappointment,
Promotion, and Tenure Decisions in the <a
href="http://www.uvm.edu/~provost/Officers_Handbookrevised_03.pdf">University
of Vermont Officers' Handbook</a> and the criteria in the Officers of
Instruction section in the Union Contract, and has the following
additional specific descriptions.  (See <a
href="#UVM-Criteria">Appendix B below</a> for a copy of the Criteria
in Appointment, Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure Decisions in the
University of Vermont Officers' Handbook.)

<!--
<h4>Teaching</h4>

Anything specific to mention?
-->

<a name="Student Selection">
<h4>3.1 Student Selection for Teaching Evaluations</h4>

<i>The following procedure was discussed at a faculty meeting on
12/4/2003, and was emailed by the Chair to all faculty on
12/6/2003.</i>

<p>

<pre>
 1. Number of students/advisees to be contacted (N)

Starting in January 2004, the Chair will contact the following numbers
of students (including advisees) for the following types of RTP
reviews:

  6: Lecturer/Senior Lecturer re-appointments with green sheet reviews
  6: First tenure-track re-appointments
 10: Senior Lecturer promotions and second tenure-track re-appointments
 12: Tenure and Associate/Full Professor promotions

 2. The candidate will be asked to provide N nominations.

At least 1/2 of these N nominations should also be the candidate's
former or present advisees.  When the candidate forwards these
nominations to the Chair, the advisees should be explicitly
identified.

 3. An ad-hoc committee will be formed each academic year by the Chair
    to provide another N nominations:

(a) The ad-hoc committee will consist of at least two members;

(b) The Department Office will provide (i) the student lists with
    grades from the candidate's last 6 years' classes, and (ii) the
    candidate's current advisee list;

(c) The ad-hoc committee will compile an initial list of at least
    1.5*N students from (b); and

(d) The candidate will be given a chance to look at this initial list
    and cross out up to 0.5*N students from the initial list.

To maintain consistency, the ad hoc committee will be formed each
academic year for all RTP candidates.

 4. The Chair will select 0.5*N students from the candidate's list and
    0.5*N students from the ad-hoc committee's list.
</pre>

<a name="Peer Teaching Evaluations">
<h4>3.2 Peer Teaching Evaluations</h4>

For each greensheet review, 2 to 3 faculty members will be invited by
the Chair to provide peer teaching evaluations. The candidate is
allowed to name up to 2 faculty members in the Department who should
not be invited for this purpose.

<p>

The peer teaching evaluations should come from eligible voters as
defined in Section 3.6.2 if at all possible.  For a candidate who
teaches a service course, the Chair is encouraged to invite an
appropriate faculty member from another department to provide a peer
teaching evaluation.

<p>

<a name="Advising">
<h4>3.3 Advising</h4>

All teaching faculty under greensheet reviews are advised to have a
separate section on advising in their greensheets, to provide
information on their undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc supervision.
In addition to student numbers, useful information would include:

<ol>

<li> How often the candidate meets with his/her students.

<li> How actively the candidate contacts them when they need the
advisor's help (e.g., when they get warning letters).

<li> Which type of feedback the candidate gets from them (relevant
thank-you messages would be useful to include).

<li> Whether the candidate has helped the Department in providing
advising help.

<li> Possible joint publications with the students and postdocs.

</ol>

<a name="Research">
<h4>3.4 Research</h4>

The University RTP criteria (see Appendix B) require "evidence that
the candidate is continuously and effectively engaged in scholarly
activity of high quality and significance."

<a name="Conference Publications">
<h5>3.4.1 Refereed Conference Publications</h5>

Refereed conference publications are very important in many computer
science areas, and getting accepted by a top-tier conference is
difficult. All research, tenure-track and tenured faculty members are
strongly encouraged to publish refereed articles in both journals and
conferences.

<p>

When listing conference publications for RPT reviews, the candidate is
asked to distinguish fully-refereed papers from non-refereed and
abstract-refereed ones, and provide information about the conference
acceptance rates if possible.

<a name="Interdisciplinary Research">
<h5>3.4.2 Interdisciplinary Research</h5>

The Department encourages and supports interdisciplinary research and
collaborations with researchers from other departments and other
institutions. Meanwhile, all tenured and tenure-track faculty members
in the Department should establish themselves as computer scientists,
and strong relevance to computer science is expected from their
interdisciplinary research.

<p>

When listing interdisciplinary publications for RPT reviews, the
candidate is advised to provide information about the relevance of the
journals and conferences to computer science. Such information may
include, but is not limited to:

<ul>

<li> How many other computer scientists have also published in the
same journal (or conference proceedings), and how often?

<li> When and where has the journal (or conference proceedings) been
cited or ranked as a computer science journal?

<li> Have many computer scientists cited articles from the
journal (or conference proceedings)?

</ul>

<a name="Co-Authors">
<h5>3.4.3 E-mail Addresses for All Co-Authors</h5>

For the following greensheet reviews, 

<ul>

<li> second re-appointment for years 6 and 7 of tenure-track
faculty,

<li> tenure and promotion to Associate Professor,

<li> promotion to the rank of Professor, and

<li> promotion to Research Associate Professor and Research Professor,

</ul>

each candidate will be asked to provide a list of e-mail addresses for
all co-authors.  Co-authors will be invited by the Chair to comment on
their perception of the role of the candidate in their joint work.

<a name="Arm's-Length Evaluators">
<h4>3.5 Selection of Arm's-Length Evaluators</h4>

For the following greensheet reviews, "arm's-length" evaluators will
be solicited to provide external reports:

<ul>

<li> second re-appointment for years 6 and 7 of tenure-track
faculty,

<li> tenure and promotion to Associate Professor,

<li> promotion to the rank of Professor, and

<li> promotion to Research Associate Professor and Research Professor.

</ul>

Arm's-length evaluators are individuals who do not have a significant
personal relationship with the candidate.  They are not former
students, thesis advisors, formal or present colleagues, co-authors,
or collaborators.

<p>

Also, each arm's-length evaluator should

<ol> 
 
<li> Be tenured in a recognized Computer Science department (or
similar), or very well-known industry-based researchers; and for
promotions to the ranks of Professor and Research Professor, be a
Professor in his/her own department.

<li> Have expertise in at least one of the candidate's research areas.

</ol>

The Chair will inform the arm's-length reviewers of all pertinent
facts regarding the candidate, with the candidate's representative
publications, and will ask them for comments on

<ul> 
 
<li> the quality of the candidate's research, 
<li> the candidate's research contributions to his/her research field,
<li> the candidate's productivity relative to other 
academics at a similar stage in  their career, 
<li> the candidate's potential as a research leader, and

<li> the publication and review standards of the journals and
conference proceedings in which the candidate has published, and their
standings in the discipline.

</ul> 

<a name="Arm's-Length - Numbers">
<h5>3.5.1 Numbers of Arm's-Length Evaluators</h5>

<ul> 
 
<li> For a second re-appointment for years 6 and 7 of tenure-track
faculty, the Chair will contact 4 arm's-length evaluators for
evaluation letters.
 
<li> For tenure and promotion to Associate Professor, and promotion to
Research Associate Professor, the Chair will contact 6 arm's-length
evaluators.
 
<li> For promotion to the rank of Professor or Research Professor, the
Chair will contact 8 arm's-length evaluators.
 
</ul> 

<a name="Arm's-Length - Selection">
<h5>3.5.2 The Selection Process</h5>

N below refers to the number of arm's-length evaluators that the Chair
will contact for each type of greensheet reviews, as defined in
Section 3.5.1.

<ol>  
  
<li> The candidate is asked to provide N nominations.

<li> The Chair compiles N other names from other sources.

<li> The Chair shows the N other names to the candidate to check
whether the candidate has a conflict of interest or
personal/professional disagreements with any of these names.

<li> The Chair selects and contacts N/2 names from the candidate's
list, and N/2 names from the other list.

</ol>  

<a name="Faculty Input and Eligible Voters">
<h4>3.6 Faculty Input and Eligible Voters for RTP Reviews</h4>

<a name="Faculty Input">
<h5>3.6.1 Faculty Input and Schedule for RTP Reviews</h5>

The Chair should set an appropriate schedule for each greensheet
review, so that the complete greensheets will be ready for faculty
review <i>at least 2 weeks before the submission deadline to the
Dean's Office</i>.

<p>

Once the greensheets are ready for faculty review, all faculty
members, tenured and untenured (including tenure-track faculty,
Lecturers, and Senior Lecturers) will be invited to review the
greensheets and share their advice concerning the candidate with the
Chair within a week. The feedback will be documented in the Chair's
Evaluation.

<p>

At the beginning of the second week after the greensheets are
complete, the Chair will convene a meeting of all eligible voters (as
defined in Section 3.6.2) to discuss and vote on whether or not to
recommend the candidate's application.  This vote will be recorded in
the Chair's Evaluation.

<p>

After the above faculty feedback and eligible voters' vote, the Chair
will decide whether or not to recommend the candidate's application,
and will inform the candidate with a detailed Chair's Evaluation.

<a name="Eligible Voters">
<h5>3.6.2 Eligible Voters for RTP Reviews</h4>

When a candidate applies for promotion to a particular rank, only
those faculty members who are already at this rank or above are
eligible voters. When a candidate applies for reappointment at a
particular rank, only those faculty members who have successfully
passed their reappointment at this rank and will not be evaluated
again for the same level of reappointment, are eligible voters.

<ul>

<li> For a Lecturer reappointment, only Senior Lecturers and tenured
faculty members are eligible voters.

<li> For a Senior Lecturer application, only Senior Lecturers and
tenured faculty members are eligible voters.

<li> For a Senior Lecturer reappointment, only tenured faculty members
are eligible voters.

<li> For a first tenure-track reappointment review, only tenured
faculty members and those faculty who have successfully passed their
first reappointment review are eligible voters.

<li> For a second reappointment review, only tenured faculty members
and those faculty who have successfully passed their second
reappointment review are eligible voters.

<li> For a tenure application, only tenured faculty members are
eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Associate Professor, only Associate
Professors and Professors are eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Professor, only Professors are
eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Research Associate Professor, only
Research Associate Professors, Research Professors, Associate
Professors and Professors are eligible voters.

<li> For a promotion application to Research Professor, only
Professors and Research Professors are eligible voters.

</ul>

The Chair is not an eligible voter.  If the number of eligible voters
is less than 3 for a particular type of greensheet review, the Chair
will consult with the candidate(s) and invite our secondary
appointments at appropriate ranks to make up at least 3 eligible
voters for each greensheet review.

<a name="Senior Lecturer">
<h4>3.7 Guidelines for Promotion to Senior Lecturer</h4>

<i>The following guidelines for promotion to Senior Lecturer were
formally approved by Dean Robert Jenkins on May 29, 2003.</i>
<p>

An application for Senior Lecturer in Computer Science will be
evaluated on the following criteria.

<ul>

<li>  A minimum of 6 years (within an eight year period) of service, as
    specified in the Union Contract
<li>  Subject to a regular RTP review without the research
    expectations
<li>  A good citizenship in terms of service activities within the
    Department
<li>  Evidence of sustained quality teaching

</ul>

<a name="Associate Professor">
<h4>3.8 Tenure and Promotion to Associate Professor</h4>

<a name="T&P Reviews">
<h5>3.8.1 Mandatory vs. Requested T&P Reviews</h5>

<ul>

<li> After 5 years' of service in a tenure-track position, a candidate
for tenure and promotion will be notified by the Chair in the
appropriate June that the review process must begin in the following
academic year, and that the candidate is asked to nominate 6
arm's-length evaluators with a given deadline.

<li> A faculty member may become a candidate at an earlier date.  In
such an early-tenure case, the faculty member should let the Chair
know by the appropriate May. The Chair may provide some informal
advice after possible consultation with tenured members in the
Department, but the decision for early-tenure application is with the
candidate.

<li> The evaluation procedure is the same for both mandatory and
requested reviews. A candidate for tenure and promotion in either case
is expected to be an established researcher in his/her research field,
in addition to the university criteria (see Appendix B).

</ul>

<a name="Withdrawal">
<h5>3.8.2 Withdrawal of Early-Tenure Applications</h5>

After the Chair's Evaluation in Section 3.6.1, an early-tenure
candidate may choose to withdraw the current tenure and promotion
application.

<a name="Professor">
<h4>3.9 Promotion to the Rank of Professor</h4>

An associate professor who wishes to be considered for promotion to
the rank of Professor should notify the Chair by the appropriate May
so that arm's-length evaluators can be organized in the following
summer.

<p>

Promotion to the rank of Professor requires a sustained record of
excellence in teaching, research, and service, and the candidate
should enjoy a recognized national or international reputation in
his/her research field.

<p>

After the Chair's Evaluation in Section 3.6.1, a candidate for
promotion to Professor may choose to withdraw the current application.

<a name="Research Promotion">
<h4>3.10 Promotion to Research Associate Professor and Research
Professor</h4>

A research faculty member may become a candidate for promotion by
personal request or by recommendation of the Chair (who is the formal
supervisor of each research faculty member in the Department).  Such a
request or recommendation should be discussed in the appropriate May
so that arm's-length evaluators can be organized in the following
summer.

<p>

Research faculty members do not have teaching or service expectations
in the Department, but if the candidate has performed significant
teaching or service work, he/she may choose to include this work in
the promotion greensheets.  

<p>

The candidate's research will be evaluated in a manner similar to that
used by the Department in evaluating promotions to Associate
Professor and Professor.

<p>

After the Chair's Evaluation in Section 3.6.1, a candidate for
promotion may choose to withdraw the current application.

<a name="Annual Review">
<h3>4. Annual Faculty Evaluations</h3>

In accordance with the Union Contract, the annual faculty review will
focus on the faculty member's performance during the academic year in
which the review takes place but will also take into account the
faculty member's performance during the preceding two years.

<p>

In late January each year, each faculty member is requested to
complete the Annual Faculty Activity Report form (see <a
href="#annual-form">Appendix A below</a>) by February 15. The faculty
may choose to include any additional relevant information.

<p>

In April each year, the Chair will meet with the faculty member to
discuss the faculty member's performance and the following academic
year's workload plan. Before or at this meeting, the faculty member
can add any written information to the faculty member's Annual Faculty
Activity Report. The Chair will provide a written evaluation for the
faculty member at or after the meeting.

<a name="Percentages of Effort">
<h4>4.1 Percentages of Faculty Effort</h4>

The percentages of effort devoted to each of the categories of
teaching, research and scholarship, and service, are initially set in
the annual April meeting between the Chair and the faculty member for
returning faculty, and during the hiring process for new faculty.
They are included in the faculty member's workload plan, and can be
modified as appropriate or necessary during the following academic
year.

<p>

The norms for these percentages are given below.

<pre>
Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant Professor

                Teaching:        40% 
                Research:        40% 
                Service:         20%        

Senior Lecturer, Lecturer

                Teaching:        80%                 
                Service:         20%        

Research Professor, Research Associate Professor and Research
Assistant Professor

                Research:       100% 
</pre>

The faculty member may wish to focus his/her energy on one particular
activity in a particular year.  In this case, the faculty member and
the Chair should agree upon revised percentages at the annual April
meeting and put them in the workload plan.

<a name="Chair's Evaluation">
<h4>4.2 Chair's Evaluation on Annual Faculty Performance</h4>

Based on 

<ol>

<li> the workload plan for the current year, 
<li> the Annual Faculty Activity Report, 
<li> possible additional information from the faculty
member before/at the annual April meeting, and
<li> course evaluations and student feedback in the past
calendar year,

</ol>

the Chair will evaluate the faculty member's performance in each of
the categories of teaching, research and scholarship, and service, if
its percentage in the workload plan is not zero.  The evaluation will
apply quality indicators in the University criteria (in Appendix B)
and in the additional Computer Science specific descriptions in
Section 3 to review the faculty member's annual performance.

<p>

The Chair will also provide one of the following 3 overall ratings on
the faculty member's annual performance:

<ul>

<li> <b>Outstanding.</b> An outstanding performance must achieve at
least two <i>excellent</i> ratings in teaching, research and
scholarship, and service.

<li> <b>Unsatisfactory.</b> An unsatisfactory performance would have
at least one <i>not acceptable</i> rating and no <i>excellent</i>
ratings in teaching, research and scholarship, and service.

<li> <b>Satisfactory.</b> A satisfactory performance is neither
outstanding nor unsatisfactory.

</ul>

<a name="Rebuttal and Appeal">
<h3>5. Rebuttal and Appeal</h3>

After receiving the Chair's Evaluation on either a RTP review or an
annual performance review, the faculty member may rebut or appeal,
following the procedures described in the Union Contract or the
Officer's Handbook.
