  <strong>CSSA Hosts Google Engineers at UVM</strong><br />
On January 23rd, 2007, the Computer Science Student Association (CSSA) hosted a team of Google engineers at UVM. Their talk, entitled &quot;Searching at Large,&quot; was a huge success   and was attended by over 200 people. Lots of Google goodies were distributed to   the audience including t-shirts, a laptop bag, lava lamp, and a lawn chair. This   lecture covered the history of Google, the basics of their search algorithms and   the underlying hardware infrastructure, the life of a Google engineer, and what   it takes to work for this wonderful company. </li>
