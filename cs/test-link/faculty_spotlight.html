<p>
Assistant Professor Josh Bongard was recently awarded the prestigious <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/?Page=News&storyID=10608">2007 Microsoft Research New Faculty Fellowship</a>.</p>
<p>His research centers on evolutionary robotics, evolutionary computation, and physical simulation. In fact, you can help with his current research exploring the nature of aesthetic   preference by answering a few questions: <a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~jbongard/Aest/">Go now!</a><a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/?Page=News&amp;storyID=9661"><img src="gfx/bongard-robot.jpg" alt="Dr. Bongard's self-healing robot" width="100" height="100" border="0" class="alignright" /></a></p>
<p>To find out more about Dr. Bongard's work, peruse <a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~jbongard/index.html">his website</a>, read an <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/theview/article.php?id=2197">interview with Josh</a>, find out about his <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/?Page=News&amp;storyID=9661">research on self-healing robots that aired on the Discovery Channel</a>, or read his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Body-Shapes-Way-Think/dp/0262162393/ref=sr_1_1/102-5226804-8890513?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1178547939&sr=1-1">How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence</a>.</p>

<p>
Assistant Professor Christian Skalka's research is supported  by grants from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and NASA. </p>
<p>His work focuses on programming languages, especially  languages such as Java that support secure distributed computing. <a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~skalka/skalka-pubs/skalka-ieesp05.pdf">Read his magazine  article</a> on this topic.<a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~skalka/TR/swe-7-07/"><img src="gfx/skalka_field.jpg" alt="Field work at the Vermont Monitoring Cooperative Meteorological site" border="0" class="alignright" /></a></p>
<p>More recently, Dr. Skalka's attention has turned to wireless  sensor network (WSN) programming. One current  project is an interdisciplinary effort to provide low-cost WSN  technology for monitoring the amount of water in  snowpack for hydrological forecasting; <a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~skalka/TR/swe-7-07/">see a trip report</a> on recent field work. Dr. Skalka also provides <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/?Page=research/ugresearch.php#skalka">research opportunities for undergraduates</a> in WSN programming.</p>
<p>For many more details about his work, <a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~skalka/">visit Dr. Skalka's  website</a>.</p>

<h4>Senior Lecturer Robert M. Erickson, MS</h4>
<p>Bob  received the prestigious <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/theview/article.php?id=2628">2007 Kroepsch-Maurice Teaching Award</a>, having joined the Computer Science faculty in 1991 after completing his Master of Science degree at Clarkson University. </p>

<p>Bob focuses on a series of web technology courses that get students to think of the web not as a series of web pages, but rather as a user interface for computer programs (see this <a href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~erickson/education/trees/">tree identification</a> example). Students' projects range from blogs, hotel management and social networking sites to volunteer opportunities (having been a <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmpr/theview/article.php?id=796">mentor</a> for seven years, Bob likes to point students in this direction).</p>

<p>In addition, Bob has written a textbook on Microsoft Office suite that students have found useful not just for the course but, based on the emails Bob receives, for years to come. One former student emailed, &quot;I still apply many of your lessons today &#151; still have your old textbook in my office &#151; do you have a new one?" The reply &#151; it's online, of course: <a href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~erickson/education/office/">2003 version</a> | <a href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~erickson/education/office2007/">2007 version</a>. </p> 
<p>For more information, <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/?Page=employee/profile.php&SM=employee/_employeemenu.html&EmID=37">visit Bob's  website</a>.</p>
