Hi All,

As you know, the new Computer Science website is live.  So that you may make 
changes to pages, you have access to the "cs" folder (permissions cannot be 
granted to specific folders within this).

You can access the cs folder using your UVM netID and password.  Just map the 
following drive:

\\zoofiles\cemswebcs

Inside the cs folder, you will find the following folders:

gfx:        graphics
grad:       Graduate Programs
newsevents: News and Seminars
research:   Research
undergrad:  Undergraduate Programs
welcome:    Chair's Welcome, Contact information, FAQs, Mission

I still have to transfer the following pages from the old website into the new 
template (currently the links go to the old website, but without the old 
navigational structure, i.e., just content):  

- In Research: Distributed Systems Group, abstracts of Technical Reports, 
Research Days
- In News & Events:  abstracts of Seminar topics

If you have any questions about the new pages, please let me know.  I'm happy 
to meet with you.  I've already met with several people who were lucky (or unlucky :-) enough to be around last week when I was going over the Undergrad pages with Jeanne.

I apologize for my slowness in granting access, but I was experiencing difficulties in getting the university to set permissions properly.  If you experience any problems, please let me know right away.

Thanks,
--Keri
