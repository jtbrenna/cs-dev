<h3>New CS Course Numbering</h3>
<p>
Starting from the Fall 2008 semester, four courses will be renumbered. The course contents are not changing (just the course numbers), and  you will be able to use the "new" courses to satisfy the "old" course requirements prescribed in catalogs up to year 2007-2008.
</p>
<p>
Below is the mapping of current to future course numbers for the four renumbered courses:
</p>
<table class="main">
<tr>
<th>CURRENT -> Fall '08+</th>
</tr>
<tr><td class="center">CS 26 &nbsp; -> CS 110</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">CS 101 ->  CS 121</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">CS 103 ->  CS 123</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">CS 104 ->  CS 124</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In addition, <strong>Math 54</strong> has been replaced by <strong>CS 64</strong>.
