<h3>Integrative Computing (iCompute)</h3>

<h4>A New Curriculum Track in Computer Science</h4>

<p>Integrative Computing (iCompute) is a new curriculum track that promotes innovative thinking through the integration of various computer science concepts and skills in building interesting applications of societal importance.</p>

<p>Embedded, networked, and mobile systems &#151; such as iPhone and Android phones, SunSPOT and "mote" wireless sensor devices, and Lego Mindstorms robotics &#151; are some of the platforms we'll use as a "playground" for our integrative computing innovations.</p>

<p>All students (CS majors or non-majors) can take this track if all the prerequisites are satisfied.</p>

<h4>Course Sequence</h4>

<p><img class="alignright" src="gfx/icompute-students.jpg" alt="Computer Science students" width="275" height="204">The course sequence for the iCompute track consists of the following:
</p>

<ul class="spacey">
<li>CS 265: Computer Networks (newly revamped - see below)</li>
<li>Two of the following four CS courses:</li>

<ul class="inspaceyul">
<li>CS 204: Database Systems</li>
<li>CS 205: Software Engineering</li>
<li>CS 228: Human-Computer Interaction</li>
<li>CS 274: Computer Graphics</li>
</ul>

<li>CS 276: Integrative Computing (new course - see below)</li>
</ul>
 

<h4><span class="red-smallital">REVAMPED!</span>CS 265: Computer Networks</h4>
<p>This course has been newly revamped to emphasize network and web programming. It is a required prerequisite of CS 276.<br />
<strong><strong><em>Expected first offer:</em></strong></strong> Spring 2010<br />
<em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> CS110 (Computer Programming II) and STAT 153</p>

<h4><span class="red-smallital">NEW!</span>CS 276: Integrative Computing Principles and Practices</h4>
<p>This is a new course (pending final approval): abstraction via APIs, distributed systems integration, security, and application design and implementation. It includes projects for networked embedded devices. In this course, students are expected to learn to apply their skills acquired during their prior course work, and design and implement innovative solutions in real-world application.<br />
<em><strong>Expected first offer:</strong></em> Fall 2010<br />
<strong><strong><em>Prerequisites:</em></strong></strong> CS 265 and two other 200-level courses in Computer Science (or by Instructor Permission)</p>

<p class="red-centerital">Expect exciting changes in other Computer Science courses <br>
that incorporate more Integrative Computing principles!</p>
