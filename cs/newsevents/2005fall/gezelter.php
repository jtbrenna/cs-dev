<p><strong>Summary</strong>
<br />
Ensuring long useful lives for hardware and software systems with the inevitable expansions, upgrades, and previously unconsidered interconnections to other systems is an architectural function. The results can be positive, resulting in long, low-cost system life, or negative leading to a system with significant limitations. Often neglected are the architectural techniques and concepts, both in terms of what behaviors are specified, and in terms of what areas are left open. The impact of these areas on the longevity of the system life cycle is often not well appreciated. We will examine how successful architectures have achieved longevity without major incompatible changes. In the end analysis, success for architecture is measured by its ability to assimilate changes in mission, implementation, interconnection, and scope.

<p><strong>Speaker Bio</strong>
<br />
Robert Gezelter, CDP, has over 30 years of experience in computing, starting with programming scientific/technical problems. Shortly thereafter, his focus shifted to operating systems, networks, security, and related matters and he has over 25 years of experience in systems architecture, programming and management. He has worked extensively in systems architecture, security, internals, and networks; ranging from high-level strategic issues to the low level specification, design, and implementation of device protocols and embedded firmware. He is the author of many published articles, which have appeared in Hardcopy, Computer Purchasing Update, Network Computing, Open Systems Today, Digital Systems Journal, and Network World. He is a frequent presenter of conference sessions on operating systems, languages, security, networks, and related topics at local, regional, national, and international conferences, speaking for DECUS, Encompass, IEEE, ISSA, ISACA, and others. Mr. Gezelter wrote the "Internet Security" chapters of The Computer Security Handbook, 3rd Edition (1995) and its supplement (1997) and then wrote chapters on securing Internet-visible sites and securing Web sites in the fourth edition of that book (2002). He was named as a Distinguished Visitor by the IEEE in 2004. Mr. Gezelter can be contacted via his firm's website at <a href="http://www.rlgsc.com">www.rlgsc.com</a>.</p>
