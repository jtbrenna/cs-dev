<p><strong>Summary</strong>
<br />
Aggregation in sensor networks has attracted significant research in optimizing its performance. Existing research has mostly concentrated on maximizing network lifetime within a user-given error bound. In general, the greater the error bound, the longer the lifetime. However, in some situations, it may not be realistic for the user to provide an error bound. Instead, the user may feel more comfortable in providing a Quality of Service (QoS) goal that has a combined objective of lifetime and error. Indeed, the error tolerable by the user may depend on how long the sensor network can last. This paper presents an aggregation protocol and related algorithms for reaching such a QoS goal. The key idea is to periodically modify a filter threshold for each sensor in a way that is optimal within the user objective, and the key technical method is to translate the problem into a mathematical programming formulation with constraints coming from various sources such as the user, the sensor network, and the data characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high accuracy, high flexibility, and low overhead of our QoS-based optimization approach.
