<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
 The Data Conservancy is funded by the NSF to address large scale data issues that arise from a vision of future sciences characterized by an increased readiness for data sharing and a commitment to data preservation. This will provide scientists with access to a large pool of shared data (for which GenBank offers a good model in molecular biology). The Data Conservancy will work with stakeholders to identify the needs of the life sciences as the discipline changes to embrace technologies that generate very large amounts of data, adds informatics tools intercept, store, organize, normalize, visualize, and analyze data, and positions the life sciences to better address large scale and complex matters such as those caused by pressures from the human population.

The promising vision of this &quot;New Biology&quot; presents challenges that will need to be overcome if we are to realize the opportunities with a new type of data-driven discovery. The Life Sciences are heterogeneous, and there are different data practices and expectations in the observational, experimental, molecular, or modeling types of biology. In some cases, the data are not yet digital. Scientists vary in the readiness to share data. There are as yet few data centers that will render data into a form that can be readily reused, shoulder curatorial responsibilities, or build new data management tools and services. The inherent heterogeneity challenges our capacity capitalize on the unity of the discipline - whether seen from a mechanistic (genetic), phylogenetic, or ecological perspective. There are three essential steps to making data-driven discovery a reality: 1) discoverability, 2) accessibility and 3) exploration. Discoverability requires indexing or registration services that can be queried, for which vocabularies of key words will be important. Accessibility implies open access and relaxed licensing, ideally allowing factual data to be regarded as being in the public domain. Exploration, which we consider to be distinct from searching, implies visualization of data. As the volume of data increases, exploratory devices will help reveal trends and discontinuities that will provoke hypotheses and a process by which understanding is improved. The initial challenge is to put in place the devices that will make data sharing part of the normal work flow across all of the Life Sciences. This will lead to a future in which data driven discovery is prominent and data aggregation is as integral to science as bench work.  </p>

<strong>Anne Thessen</strong> has a BS in Marine Biology from Nicholls State University in Louisiana and a PhD in biological oceanography from University of Maryland.  Her undergraduate and graduate research focus was on harmful algal blooms, specifically the toxic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.  Her postdoctoral research included work on Arctic primary productivity, the Encyclopedia of Life and the International Census of Marine Microbes.  Right now she is a research associate at the Marine Biological Laboratory working on Life Science data issues for the Data Conservancy, an NSF DataNet project.
