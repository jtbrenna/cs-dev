<strong>Bryan Ceberio, a CEMS Junior majoring in Computer Science</strong>,obtained an internship in the Spring of 2013 with the <a href=http://www.higherturnover.com/ target=_blank>Higher Turnover Websites</a>, a web-based marketing solutions company in Shelburne, Vermont specializing in creating custom websites for auto dealers across the country.

His primary duty for this internship was to rewrite the company's existing programming code to a more updated version. He is currently working on a project to upgrade the front-end code in the staging environment, making sure that it meets the proper standards before moving it into production. He also works on additional projects where he collaborates with his manager to add new features to the existing administration panel.

<i>"This internship has been an exciting opportunity for me. Not only am I gaining additional experiences that I can add to my resume, but as a student simultaneously working and taking classes, I am able to maintain a studious work ethic that employers can recognize. It has also exposed me to new programming techniques and different approaches for constructing dynamic websites and improving my overall knowledge in PHP programming.
<p>
But what really amazes me is the fact that I was given the motivation I needed from my counselors, and that they were able to connect me with a company that relates to my career values. I can honestly say that I wouldn't have been given the chance to be part of such a wonderful company as Higher Turnover if it weren't for the good people at Vermont HITEC. I am truly grateful for their services!"</i>
