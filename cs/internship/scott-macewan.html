<b>Scott MacEwan, a CEMS Senior majoring in Computer Science</b>, obtained an internship in the Spring of 2013 with <a href=http://www.bluehousegroup.com/ target=_blank>Bluehouse Group</a>, a web development and marketing solutions company in Richmond, Vermont specializing in creating "websites that work."
<p>

<i>"Simply put, this internship has been immensely rewarding. I have learned so much in my time here that it really astounds me. I knew very little about JavaScript coming into this internship, and honestly, I am now more comfortable with it than most other languages I knew before starting here. I got to strengthen my skills with PHP and MySQL. Also, learning how to manage time on large projects and how to work both autonomously and with other people has really strengthened my skills as a programmer. 
<p>
If I could say one thing to other students considering an internship, it would be: don't let your nervousness stop you from seeking an internship. I know a lot of people are nervous when it comes to pursuing an internship, especially if they have never had one before. The experience is so valuable and the mentoring that comes as part of the experience accelerates your growth unbelievably fast.  
<p>
As far as how this internship has impacted my career decision, I can officially say, this is my career now. I had the pleasure of accepting a full time position and I couldn't be more excited."</i>
