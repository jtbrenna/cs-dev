<p><strong>Aaron Morton, a CEMS Junior majoring in Computer Science</strong>, obtained an internship in Summer 2012 with the <a href=compass-school.org target=_blank>Compass School</a>, an alternative secondary school located in Westminster, Vermont.  His challenge was to overhaul and upgrade many aspect s of their information technology systems. Aaron quickly found how valuable project management skills are while juggling tasks such as installing a new computer system for the school, rewiring the server room, migrating materials from legac y products to the new system, creating quick start guides for teachers and staff, meeting and teaching users on the new system, offering tech support as needed, creating policies and procedures for data storage, and putting in safeguards to protect the network.</p>

As was stated by his on-site mentor, Michael McConnel, Aaron was an outstanding intern and would be welcomed back in the future. His motivation, desire, thoughtful demeanor, and technical skills were very valuable.

"I'm not sure what else to say. If Aaron weren't in college and I could pick up the one more client I would need to cover the cost to hire him, I would do so in an instant. He excelled at everything I threw his way, worked independently as needed, asked questions when necessary, the quality of his work was superlative, he never backed down when deep in the dumps of a really tough situation... overall, he excelled."

For Aaron, his CEMS internship experience provided daily challenges which complemented his academic studies - a perfect combination of theory and its real-world application.</p>
