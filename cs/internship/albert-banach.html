<b>Albert J Banach, a CEMS Junior majoring in Computer Science</b>, obtained an internship in the Summer of 2013 with <a href=www.harbourind.com target=_blank>Harbour Industries</a>, a manufacturing company in Shelburne, Vermont specializing in the manufacture of high temperature and high performance cable for the military, commercial, and industrial markets.

AJ spent his summer as a full-time intern at Harbour Industries in their IT Department on a variety of projects but focused on database management.

<i>"My experience at Harbour Industries has been amazing.  Finally working full-time and being in an office environment, I was able to get a taste of what it will be like once I graduate.  In the few months that I've been here, I have learned more than I could have imagined about working at this type of job.  From the office experience to the wonderful coworkers, I was very fortunate to have gotten the chance to work for this company.  I would especially like to mention my IT manager, Jeff Cofran, who was the best boss and teacher I could have asked for.  The majority of the internship was working side by side with Jeff.  Watching what he did to manage everything, and how he did it.  For most of the projects, he would not only show me how he was doing everything, he would explain it until I understood, and even have me doing things myself.  The level of mentoring I've received from him was very high and I'm grateful for everything he's taught me.
<p>
Throughout the summer, I was able to learn a lot about myself - my work habits, how I was able to learn, and how to work with others.  I was able to notice that I was able to do my best work in the morning rather than the end of the day and how to plan accordingly.  After the first few days, my boss and I found out that I will learn more by doing something once with his instruction than watching him do the same thing many times.  Once we both realized this, we were able to make a lot of progress.  One of the most valuable things that I've learned this summer is to find out the work ethic and how to cooperate with another person.  With this skill, we were able to get a lot of the projects done. 
<p>
For this internship, I worked a lot on side IT projects - setting up computers, networking printers, managing the website, and helping out coworkers with anything computer related.  I learned a lot about setting up a network and troubleshooting problems that might be happening to a computer and how to fix them.  However, the majority of the internship went to managing their databases.  I learned a lot about programming with Progress and running the scripts on the database.  The biggest project this summer went to the Binary Dumps and Loads of the Train Database to make new testing and archive environments.  Jeff and I both worked together on that since we were both unfamiliar with the process and by the end of the summer, I was able to do the dump and load myself.
<p>
I would definitely recommend this internship program to anyone considering it.  You can take all the classes in the world, but nothing can compare to actually getting the hands-on experience from the concepts you learn.  I was very fortunate to be taking part in this, especially starting off as late in the game as I did.  Signing up with VT HITEC was one of the best decisions I've ever made.  They are very dedicated in getting in touch with great employers for their students and they will do everything they can to make sure their students get one, and for that I am very grateful.
<p>
Thanks for all you've done for me this summer."</i>
