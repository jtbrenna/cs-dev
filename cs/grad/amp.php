Accelerated Master's Program (AMP)</h3>
<p>(Revised June 2013)</p>

<p>The Department offers an Accelerated Master's Program (AMP) for
exceptional undergraduate students to complete both a bachelor's and
master's degree in Computer Science within a five-year period.</p>

<p>Students accepted into the AMP may apply up to 6 credits of their
undergraduate Computer Science courses at the 200-level taken at UVM
toward a Master's degree. These courses must be approved in advance by
the Graduate Committee. The student must complete any additional
requirements for taking these courses for graduate credit.</p>

<p>With permission of the Graduate Committee and the Graduate College,
students may apply additional computer science credits taken at the
graduate level prior to completing their undergraduate degree, which
are not required for their undergraduate degree, to their Master's
degree.</p>

<p>Only courses taken after the admission to AMP can be counted toward
a graduate degree. So apply early (before the second semseter of the
junior year) to have time to plan two courses that can be used toward
your graduate (MS) degree.</p>

<p>Many AMP students begin work on their thesis research or project
immediately after completing their undergraduate degree. These
students may take their comprehensive exams split into multiple
consecutive exam periods (e.g., early winter, early summer).</p>

<p> Students interested in the AMP should contact <a href=http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=grad/amp-guide.php&SM=grad/_gradmenu.html#gradcoord>The Computer Science Graduate Coordinator</a> 
during their junior year.</p>
