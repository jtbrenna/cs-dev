<h4>Information for Applicants</h4>
<br />
<h5>Uniqueness of Our PhD Program</h5>
<p>Doctoral programs are fundamentally different than Bachelor's or Master's degree programs. Like other programs, doctoral students gain a base level of knowledge through course work. The difference, however, comes with research.
Whereas a Bachelor's or Master's student may undertake a research project, it merely provides a complement to the course work and is clearly guided by a faculty advisor. Doctoral research is the focus of any doctoral student's studies. Doctoral research is much more self-guided and exploratory than research done in the other programs. Future employers typically select doctoral students on the quality and originality of their thesis research, not their grades in course work. Reflecting this focus, the bulk of time and effort during a student's doctoral studies is spent on thesis research.</p>
<p>In the last thirty-plus years, computer science has developed into a rich academic discipline. But computers and computation also play a key role in many research disciplines, including (but not limited to) engineering, biology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, economics and education. Against such a backdrop, our <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> PhD program produces Computer Science professionals capable of teaching and performing original research at the university level as well as in industrial or other professional settings.</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary PhD program in Computer Science offers study in both traditional and cross-disciplinary areas such as bioinformatics and ecological modeling, and includes <b>graduate assistantships specifically designated for students involved in interdisciplinary areas</b>. Our faculty in Computer Science are involved in the forefront of research in knowledge and data engineering (such as <a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/research/kdd/index.shtml">data mining</a>, <a href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/dbgroup/">database systems</a>, pattern recognition, and knowledge-based systems), software engineering and verification (including programming languages), and computational sciences (comprising <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/?Page=research/compbio.php&amp;SM=research/_researchmenu.html">evolutionary &amp; agent-based computing</a><a href="../?Page=research/compbio.php&amp;SM=research/_researchmenu.html"></a>, discrete modeling, and numerical methods). Our interdisciplinary work cuts across all areas of campus, with current emphasis in bioinformatics, computational imaging, computational engineering, and ecological modeling. Our faculty publish in prestigious journals and conferences in Computer Science, have significant research grants from federal agencies (such as NIH, DOE, and DOD), and serve on editorial boards, conference committees, National Science Foundation review panels, and leading professional societies.</p>
<p>Doctoral students are expected to include courses from beyond the traditional realm of computer science. Students are encouraged to consider research topics that combine computer science with other disciplines. The Department has a broad range of secondary faculty appointments with primary interests in other fields who may be used as a student's thesis advisor. Many other faculty at the University have a research interest that includes computer science or computation; these faculty can serve as a co-advisor to a student (see <a href="../?Page=grad/phd-guide.php&amp;SM=grad/_gradmenu.html#degreereqs">degree requirements</a>, below).</p>

<p class="return"><a href="../?Page=grad/phd-guide.php&SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">Return to top</a></p>

<h5>PhD Program Minimum Requirements for Admission</h5>
<p>A Bachelor's degree and satisfactory scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) general section are required of all applicants. Applicants will be evaluated based on their potential for excellence in research, as judged from their academic background, test scores, relevant experience and letters of recommendation. We admit students who we believe are most likely to succeed and thrive in the program. See the next section for complete application packet requirements and deadlines.</p>
<p>Applicants whose native language is not English or whose formal education has been conducted in a language other than English must have a Test of English as a Second Language (TOEFL) score of 550 (or 213 with computer-based test or 79 with Internet-based test) or above.  To be considered for assistantship from the University, applicants must have a TOEFL score of 600 (or 250 with computer-based test or 100 with Internet-base test) or above.</p>
<p>Applicants who have strong academic records in a different discipline and lack an acceptable computer science background (normally including at least courses in Data Structures, Computer Organization and Programming Languages) may be accepted provisionally. Provisionally accepted students will be required to complete an approved program of remedial work within their first year of study.</p>

<h5>Funding for Students</h5>
<p>The Department of Computer Science is able to fund a small number of graduate students at any time. In addition, the department awards a small number of graduate assistantships specifically designated for PhD students involved in interdisciplinary areas.</p>
<p>The first form of funding is as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA). Each GTA spends 20 hours each week during the school year (starting 1 week before classes begin) supporting the department's educational mission. This work typically involves some combination of grading, offering help sessions or office hours and monitoring student labs. Each GTA will be assigned a specific number of hours for each task and will work under the guidance of the faculty member teaching the course or lab. Each GTA must also attend a series of short training sessions early in their first semester.</p>
<p>The Graduate Committee nominates potential GTAs from the pool of admitted students. GTAs are selected from the best students in the program who best fit the department's needs. It is possible, although not common, to gain GTA funding after one or more semesters as an unfunded graduate student. GTA students who continue to satisfy the department's requirements and make satisfactory progress towards their degree will maintain their funding. </p>
<p>Funding as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) is also available. The
research funding
comes from various sources. Students with exceptional research
potential in the funded areas will be considered as GRAs. All admitted students indicating interest in departmental funding will be considered for all available funded positions. The only requirement of the applicant is to indicate interest in departmental funding on the application.</p>

<h5>Additional Information </h5>
<p>
Hopefully, this document and the Department webpages (<a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/">www.uvm.edu/~cems/cs/</a>) can answer most of your questions about the program.
</p>
<p>Potential students should feel free to contact the department with further questions. The email address <a href="mailto:csgrad-info@cs.uvm.edu">csgrad-info@cs.uvm.edu</a> is the best way to reach an appropriate member of the department to ask any other questions you may have. </p>

<h4>Advisor and Studies
Committe</a>e</h4>
<p>Within the first semester of a doctoral student's first arrival at the
Department, the Graduate Committee will appoint a<b> Studies Committee</b> for that student. The Studies Committee is made up of at least three graduate faculty members, at least two of whom must hold appointments in
Computer Science and at least one of whom must hold a primary appointment (see the list of graduate faculty <a href="../?Page=grad/phd-guide.php&amp;SM=grad/_gradmenu.html#advisorlist">below</a>). The Graduate Committee will
appoint a member of the studies committee as its chair. The chair of the studies committee is also the student's <b>PhD advisor</b> of record and must hold an appointment in Computer Science.</p>
<p>A student may petition the Graduate Committee at any time to change
the membership of their Studies Committee. Every student is expected to choose their own PhD advisor and should do so as early in their PhD studies as possible.</p>
<p>A PhD advisor serves as the mentor during a student's PhD training. It is important that the student feels comfortable discussing issues with the advisor. Students should choose a PhD advisor based on three factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>common interest in a research problem, </li>
  <li>comfortable working relationship, and </li>
  <li>willingness of the advisor to advise the student.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Students should meet with potential advisors early in their PhD studies. They should talk with that person about potential research topics to see if the potential advisor's work interests them. Also, students should try to see whether they would be comfortable working with that person. A potential advisor should tell the student whether he or she is willing to take the student on as a PhD advisee. Only a willing graduate faculty member with an appointment in Computer Science can serve as an advisor.</p>
<p>A student's studies committee oversees that student's preparations for
research, ensuring that the student has both the breadth in Computer Science and the depth in a research area to successfully complete his or her degree. Under the supervision of the Graduate Committee, the studies committee has two areas of authority: establishing the student's course requirements and
approving the student's thesis proposal. A student should make a progress report to the studies committee at least once a year (required in February) and submit an annual report (see the template (Word <a href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~bslee/gradinfo/PhDannualReportTemplate.doc">DOC</a> or <a href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~bslee/gradinfo/PhDannualReportTemplate.docx">DOCX</a>). A finalized annual report should be submitted to the graduate committee for its approval.</p>


<h5>PhD Advisor List</h5>
<p>The following is the current list of faculty who can serve as thesis advisors:</p>

<h4>PhD Degree Requirements</h4>
<p>A student's doctoral program consists of four stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gaining a sound basis in computer science, primarily through
    course work</li>
  <li>gaining appropriate depth and breadth in a research area</li>
  <li>choosing an appropriate research problem</li>
  <li>completing the thesis research and documenting that research in a
    dissertation</li>
</ul>
<p>Four hurdles mark the completion of these stages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the oral comprehensive exam demonstrates the breadth of knowledge in computer science</li>
  <li>the written comprehensive exam demonstrates the research-readiness</li>
  <li>the thesis proposal describes the chosen research problem</li>
  <li>the dissertation and oral thesis defense conclude the thesis
    research</li>
</ul>
<p>Details are explained below.</p>

<h5>Credit Hours and Course Requirements</h5>
<p>The PhD in Computer Science degree requires a minimum of <b>75</b> credit hours earned in courses and in dissertation research. The Computer Science PhD program has minimal fixed requirements, providing flexibility to the studies committees (<a href="../?Page=grad/phd-guide.php&amp;SM=grad/_gradmenu.html#advisors">see above</a>) to tailor a program appropriate for each individual student. All students must take a minimum of <b>15 credits</b> (normally 5 courses) of course work (<i>only courses with grades of B- or above are counted towards this minimum requirement</i>). We expect a typical student to take 30-40 credits of course work beyond their undergraduate degree. Each student must learn enough fundamental material during the first two years to pass the comprehensive examinations. For most students, the bulk of this learning will come from course work. The Department also strongly recommends that each student take at least six credit hours (normally two courses) of courses from other departments.</p>
<p>All course work must be done in 200 or above level courses with the exception that a student may apply <b>two</b> 100-level (<i>excluding 100-level CS courses</i>), three-credit courses towards their graduate programs (with the pre-approval of the Graduate College). Note <i>all</i> course work must be approved by the student's Studies Committee and the Graduate Committee.</p>
<p>The courses a student uses towards the degree must be approved by his/her studies committee.</p>
<p>For <b>students with a Master's degree</b>, a maximum of <b>24</b> hours of course credits completed during work on a Master's degree can be transferred towards the doctoral requirements. These courses may have been completed while a student at the University of Vermont or elsewhere. For more information, see UVM's <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/academics/catalogue2006-07/?Page=allpolicies.php&amp;SM=policymenu.html&amp;category=graduate_policies&amp;policy=Transfer%20Credit%20and%20Credit%20by%20Examination%20for%20Graduate%20Students">Transfer Credit and Credit by Examination for Graduate Students</a>.</p>

<h5>Minimum Residence Requirements</h5>
<p>Candidates for the doctoral degree must satisfactorily complete a minimum of <b>51</b> hours in residence. The residency requirement is completed by courses that (1) are taken for graduate credit through The University of Vermont either in the academic year or summer on the main campus or at off-campus locations, and (2) are taken after the student has been admitted to the Graduate College.</p>

<p class="return"><a href="../?Page=grad/phd-guide.php&SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">Return to top</a></p>

<h5>Comprehensive Exams</h5>
<p>Each student must pass the comprehensive exams before graduating. Details can be found in the <a  href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~bslee/gradinfo/CompExamGuidelines.txt"> CS comprehensive exam guidelines</a>. Under no circumstances will more than two attempts at the comprehensive exams be allowed.</p>

<p>Each student planning to take the oral part of a comprehensive exam should consult with the Studies Committee to determine the topical areas and examiners and then inform the Graduate Committee of the decision at least 60 days before the scheduled exam date. The student also needs to schedule an examination date with the examiners and inform the Graduate Committee. It is strongly recommended that the examination is completed during the academic year, unless all examiners agree to give the exam on a date during the break.</p>

<p>Students must enroll in GRAD 497: Doctoral Comprehensive Examination prior to taking the comprehensive examination. There is no fee. A grade of &quot;S&quot; or &quot;U&quot; is recorded.</p>

<p class="return"><a href="../?Page=grad/phd-guide.php&SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">Return to top</a></p>

<h5>Thesis Proposal</h5>
<p>Once the student has mastered the basic material in a research area and
chosen a thesis topic, they must present that topic to the studies
committee and the larger Computer Science community. Each student must present a written thesis proposal to the studies committee a minimum of two weeks prior to the thesis proposal. The thesis proposal itself is a public presentation of the student's thesis topic. An abstract of the proposal will be announced to the Computer Science community a minimum of seven days prior to the thesis proposal and will be clearly advertised to the community. Although the thesis topic is by nature a work in progress at this stage, the student should be able to
clearly identify and communicate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the idea being explored</li>
  <li>why the idea is important</li>
  <li>how the student can complete the research</li>
  <li>why the idea is novel</li>
  <li>what related work exists</li>
</ul>

<h5>Oral Exam</h5>
<p>Following the public thesis proposal, the studies committee will
hold a closed oral area examination of the student. The student must
demonstrate sufficient breadth and depth of understanding of the research area to satisfy the members of the studies committee. For both the thesis proposal and the oral exam, the student's studies committee may:</p>
<ul>
  <li>pass the student</li>
  <li>pass with additional work required</li>
  <li>fail the student</li>
</ul>
<p>Any additional work required by the studies committee must be
completed before the student defends the thesis. This work is assigned to cover deficiencies in either the thesis itself or the student's mastery of
the surrounding research area. A student failing either the thesis proposal or the oral exam may petition the Graduate Committee for permission to attempt the proposal and oral exam again. Students in this position should be sure to have detailed discussions with their studies committee to understand why they failed in the previous attempt.</p>

<h5>Candidacy</h5>
<p>A student successfully completing the course requirements, the comprehensive examinations, the thesis proposal and the oral exam will advance to candidacy for the PhD degree.</p>

<p class="return"><a href="../?Page=grad/phd-guide.php&SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">Return to top</a></p>

<h5>Thesis Defense and Thesis Committee</h5>
<p>After completing their  research, including at least 30 credit
hours of doctoral dissertation research,  doctoral candidates must publicly defend their thesis before their thesis committee (also called Dissertation Defense Examination Committee). The thesis committee must include at least four members and must be approved by the Graduate Committee and the Dean of the Graduate College. This thesis committee
must include at least one member from outside the department who will
serve as the chair of the thesis committee.</p>
<p>The thesis defense presentation is open to the public. It must be advertised widely via email and public postings. The end of the thesis defense is closed; during this portion, the thesis committee may ask any questions of the student. Students must submit a written thesis to the Graduate College for a format check a minimum of three weeks before their defense. Students must provide copies of the written dissertation to each member of the thesis committee a minimum of two weeks before the defense.</p>
<p>After considering the written dissertation, the public presentation of the thesis and the student's answers to the questions, the thesis committee may:</p>
<ul>
<li>pass the student without revisions</li>
<li>pass the student with minor revisions</li>
<li>pass the student with major revisions</li>
<li>fail the student</li>
</ul>
<p>The student must submit minor revisions for approval to his or her
advisor. The student must submit major revisions to the entire committee for approval. Students failing their defense may petition the Graduate Committee for an additional attempt. If the Graduate Committee denies the petition, the student is dismissed from the program.</p>
<p>Students must enroll in GRAD 499: Dissertation Defense prior to
defending their thesis.</p>

<p class="return"><a href="../?Page=grad/phd-guide.php&SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">Return to top</a></p>

<h5>Other Requirements</h5>
<p> To remain in good standing, students must continue to make reasonable
progress towards completing their degree requirements. To measure this
progress, the following requirements are placed on all PhD students:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Time limit.</b> All full-time students (taking at least 15
credits/year) must successfully pass their comprehensive exams within 3
years of enrollment (not counting the time while on provisional
status). All part-time students must successfully pass their
comprehensive exams within 5 years of enrollment (again not counting
the time while on provisional status). Extensions may be awarded
for extraordinary extenuating circumstances, at the discretion of the Graduate Committee. The Department expects all full-time students to complete their degree within 6 years of enrollment, and part-time students to complete their degree with 8 years of enrollment.</li>
<li><b>Individual course grade. </b>A student may be dismissed from
the Graduate College if two grades or more below a B (3.00) or the
designation of &quot;U&quot; in Thesis or Dissertation Research or Seminar are
received.

<li><b>Accumulative grade point average (GPA).</b> Every PhD
student must maintain a GPA of 3.00 (B) at all times in the courses taken
at the University of Vermont. Any students falling below a 3.00 will be placed on academic probation and their progress will be reviewed by the Graduate Committee, with the possible imposition of sanctions.</li>
</ul>
<p>A PhD in Computer Science implies more skills than simply the ability to perform research in computer science. Thus the program requires students to gain acceptable experience in <b>teaching</b>, <b> programming</b> and the <b> communication</b> of technical ideas.</p>
<p><b>Teaching.</b> All doctoral students must gain acceptable experience in teaching. Taking into consideration the student's expressed long-term career interests, the student's Studies Committee will define a
role the student must take in assisting the Department in teaching its courses. These responsibilities may range from being a grader for multiple courses to being the primary instructor for a single course.</p>
<p><b>Programming.</b> The Studies Committee must also define a
mechanism for the student to demonstrate competence in programming. For
most students, this competence will be demonstrated by successful completion
of a
course that includes a significant programming component. Courses that
satisfy this requirement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CS202 Compiler Construction</li>
<li>CS205 Software Engineering</li>
<li>CS207 Software Implementation and Verification</li>
<li>CS260 Parallel Algorithms and Programming Techniques</li>
<li>CS274 Computer Graphics</li>
</ul>
<p>Other courses that satisfy this requirement may be approved by the
Graduate Committee. The studies committee may alternatively certify the student as having satisfied this requirement (with the approval of the Graduate Committee) based on other criteria, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>past experience</li>
<li>a programming project</li>
<li>a programming component to the thesis research</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Communication. </b>Research is of little use if it is not communicated to others. Furthermore, a doctoral student's reputation is largely based on his or her writing and presentation. All doctoral students should be able to communicate original
technical ideas orally and in writing. Although significant differences exist between oral and written presentations, the basic organizational skills and efforts are similar. All communication must make several points clearly:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the research idea?</li>
<li>What is its contribution?</li>
<li>Why is it different from previous work?</li>
</ul>
<p>The student's advisor will establish speaking and writing
requirements for the student. The advisor will be responsible for certifying that the student has gained sufficient proficiency in speaking and writing.</p>

<h5>Sample Programs of Courses</h5>
<p>The curricular requirements of our PhD program are flexible enough
to accommodate students with varying backgrounds and interdisciplinary
interests. Students will work closely with their graduate Studies Committee to design curricula that are commensurate with their backgrounds and interests. <a href="../?Page=grad/phd-samples.php&amp;SM=grad/_gradmenu.html">Click here</a> for sample programs.</p>

<h4>Courses and Offering Frequencies</h4>
<p>The Department offers 200-level courses, which are taken both by advanced undergraduate students and graduate students. Students taking 200-level courses for graduate credit typically need to do additional work, frequently a project or class presentation. The Department also offers 300-level courses, which are open only to graduate students.</p>
<p>For the description of each course and its offering frequency in the past, see our official course listing at <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/academics/courses/browse/?category=CS">www.uvm.edu/academics/courses/browse/?category=CS</a>. Note that course offering frequencies often change due to enrollment demands. Talk to your advisor for more details.</p>
