<b>Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate Opportunity for Competitive Research Programs Relating to Research on Adaptation to Climate Change</b>
</center>
<p>
Seeking interested Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) applicants for 1 (one) open position commencing in the spring of 2014.  This GRA will participate in two synergetic research thrusts around Research on Adaptation to Climate Change and NEWRnet, both funded by the National Science Foundation.  We seek a highly motivated student who wishes to train and carry out novel Ph.D. level team-centered research relative to adaptation to climate change which integrates lake ecology, watershed ecology, land use management, numerical modeling, policy and social modeling, and modeling of complex systems.  Additional information on the Research on Adaptation to Climate Change may be found at: 
<a href=http://www.newrnet.org/ target=_blank>http://www.newrnet.org/</a> and
<a href=http://www.uvm.edu/~epscor/new02/?q=node/30 target=_blank>http://www.uvm.edu/~epscor/new02/?q=node/30</a>.
<p>
The successful Ph.D. candidate will have a strong interest in integrating computer science programming and modeling platforms with institutional-design, decision-science and policy-systems frameworks.  He/she will also be able to work with undergraduates and high school students for outreach efforts as appropriate. 
<p>
The scope of work relating to this GRA will include the successful pursuit of a dissertation with guidance from leading faculty in this emerging field, that draws upon the creation and calibration of agent-based models through data drawn from interactive gaming platforms designed to draw on remote sensing data pertaining to water volume and quality under a variety of land use and policy scenarios. Part of the dissertation research will be development of calibrated models of decision-making, policy and governance networks accountable for managing water quality.  With further questions concerning the scope of work please contact Asim Zia, <a href=mailto:azia@uvm>azia@uvm</a>.
<p>
The individual selected will be expected to interact substantially across the projects. Start date <b>January 1, 2014</b>, or as soon as possible thereafter.  Applications will be reviewed immediately.
<p>
Qualified applicants must meet the requirement for admission to the University of Vermont's Ph.D. in Computer Science Program and be accepted by VT EPSCoR to receive funding.
