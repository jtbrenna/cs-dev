<p>The Department offers an Accelerated Master's Program (AMP) for exceptional   undergraduate students to complete both a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science within a five-year period.</p>
<p>Students   accepted into the AMP may apply up to 6 credits of their undergraduate Computer Science courses at the 200-level taken at UVM toward a Master's degree. These courses must be approved in advance by the Graduate Committee. The student must complete any additional requirements for taking these courses for graduate credit.</p>
<p>
Many AMP students begin work on their thesis research immediately after completing their undergraduate degree. With permission of the Graduate Committee and the Graduate College, students may apply additional computer science credits taken at the graduate level prior to completing their undergraduate degree, which are not required for their undergraduate degree, to their Master's degree.
